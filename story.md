The Isles of Maga
=================
![Region Map](region-map.png)

The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, but here is what is common knowledge. The date of this information is 5E308 (the 308th year of the fifth era, which began with the founding of the Modern Republic).

Physical Geography
------------------
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area of nearly one million square kilometers (approximately the size of Kazakhstan) and contains thousands of islands if not more. The islands all have a tropical climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat between subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and severity of their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of Magathos has a mountain range called the Otris Mountains, the peaks of which are tall enough to be snow-capped. As a result of the difference of elevation, this island has alpine grasslands, forests, and tundra.

The Isles of Maga are in the Sunbound Ocean, far away from any mainland continent, although some exist. Historically there has been trade with the closest mainland in the west, called Honstrad, but in recent history travel has been cut off.

Political Geography
-------------------
Maga is governed by the Modern Republic. Clusterings of islands form a district; the district that gets the most attention in this document is the Capital District, which contains the capital and nearby islands.

The capital of the country is Thronerock, located in the Otris Mountains in Magathos. Other cities in Magathos are Honuda, Grostine, Ledalia, and Sorrowport. Nearby major islands are Veldoth, Ruzark, Eyedea, Northsky, Olivon, Hosland, Brightwater, and Shaleport. Each island has at least one port city, which is the center of most trade. The cities on Magathos also have a significant inland trade.

Magathos has an area of 5,000 square kilometers, and is the largest island in Maga. The other islands listed vary in size, and are anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 square kilometers. There are other important trade islands that are much smaller, being no more than 100 or so square kilometers.

Although the inside of the Otris Mountains are very developed by Dwarves, the outside of the mountains have not largely been touched by civilization. A great number of unique wildlife make their homes there, as well as some unintegrated beast races.

Political System
----------------
The Modern Republic has a president as head of state. The representatives are chosen by the Electorate, who are the descendants of the revolutionaries who violently overthrew the Elven Kingdoms that preceded the Republic. The majority of the Electorate are Dwarves, with a significant minority of Humans and Halflings. Elves represent a very small minority of the Electorate; less than 1% are Elves, who are the descendants of those Elves that rebelled against their own kingdom. None of the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) have any members in the Electorate. As of 5E308, the president is Grulth Skullstone, an elderly Dwarf who personally participated in the establishing of the Republic in a minor role.

History
-------
Although it has been touched upon, here is an organized account of the history of Maga.

### Before 1E (before colonization by the four human-like races)

Before the arrival of Dwarves, Elves, Humans, and Halflings, there is strong evidence that Maga was under the rule of a powerful Orcish civilization. This is evidenced by the presence of the Orcish alphabet among the languages of Goblins and Gnomes, as well as the huge number of monsters that share the language of Orcs entirely. Furthermore, there are ancient ruins that have a distinct Orcish architecture. However, the Orcs did not keep a history of their civilization, so very little is known about it. The arrival of the human-like races did not disrupt their civilization; it had collapsed into the tribal society that is seen among Orcs up to the 5th era some time before that, for reasons that may never be known.

During this time, the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) also populated the region. They likely were also ruled by the Orcish civilization.

### 1E: The Era of Exploration

The first era saw the first Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings reach the shores of Maga. In the beginning their numbers were few, but as they explored more and more of Maga they became more prevalant. Eventually the majority of Maga became populated with these human-like races. There were not many conflicts within these races, instead the focus being on clearing out the area of the hostile locals, including the beast races.

In particular, the Orcs were resistant to what they perceived as invaders. Up to the fifth era, the various Orcish tribes continue to put up a fight, although their numbers have diminished significantly. It is this continued hostility that has prevented from them being integrated with any of the upcoming civilizations, unlike the beast-races.

### 2E: The Era of Industry

The second era was a time of peace, after the Orcish residents and other hostile races were mostly cleared out, and before the beginning of the formation of states that would prevail during the third era. What were formerly small villages began to grow and eventually become cities. Dwarves continued to build underground, and the other races continued forming new villages and cities on the various islands. This era also marked the beginning of interaction with beast-races, and when people began to learn about the local worship of Demon Lords and share their religion.

Trade flourished during this time, and industries were becoming better established to fight off hostile races, sail the rougher parts of the waters, clearing out of the jungle terrain, and the development under the Otris Mountains by the Dwarves.

### 3E: The Era of Statecraft

During the third era, the separate races formed their own states. The greatest state belonged to the kingdom of the Dwarves, which held the seat of Thronerock which is still the location of the council during the fifth era. Elves, Humans, and Halflings had smaller city states, but many were strong enough to compare to the unified Dwarven kingdom.

The Elves had worshipped Gora for many ages before, but for the first time worship of Gora was organized into churches as an organized religion. They viewed the demon worship of the natives as well as the other human-like races as disgusting and evil given the misanthropic tendencies of some Demon Lords. However, they were not in a position to do anything about it, and traded with these races anyway.

The Dwarves were proud of their strength as a country, and limited their interaction with the other races during this time. They would continue carving out huge castles underground in and around the Otris Mountains and the rest of Magathos. The other races, on the other hand, had more or less amicable relations with each other and traded with one another.

The Elves saw an increase of power through non-military means, by enveloping Human and Halfling city states with the promise of greater protection from hostile races like the Orcs, and access to important islands for trade. The city states retained their autonomy in terms of laws, but would swear fealty towards these Elven kings and paid a small tax to them.

Towards the end of the era, the various Elven kings controlled most of Maga, except for around the Magathos region. Seeing that the Dwarves were weakened, and the economic importance of Magathos, the Elves launched a full scale invasion. The Dwarves were completely unprepared for this. They fought valiantly, but in the end the Elves controlled Magathos and the surrounding area, and the Magathos region established its own kingdom ruled by an Elf monarch.

### 4E: The Elven Kingdoms

The beginning of the fourth era saw the first unification of the races under one banner: the banner of the Elves. There was not a centralized government, but a number of allied kingdoms, each with an Elf as monarch. One after another, each region was conquered by the Elves, and the greatest Elf kingdom was on Magathos, seated at Thronerock.

Elvish was the Common language, although this was not strictly enforced and many regions had the majority race's language as a co-official language. Each race was still free to use its own alphabet for their language.

This era also saw the greatest attempt to completely stamp out demon worship. By the end of the fourth era, worship of Demon Lords among Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings was nearly completely obliterated, and all worshipped the more abstract deity Gora. Less effort was put into stamping out worship among the beast-races due to the fact that they were not integrated as citizens, although some minor missions were carried out.

Although in the beginning the Elven kings and queens were careful to be even-handed, the descendants who would inherit their thrones became increasingly unconcerned with the needs of their subjects. Many of the monarchs during the end of the period were incredibly harsh, even to Humans who held the highest positions in society besides Elves. Halfling farmers and Dwarf miners were taxed more and more onerously.

### 5E: The Modern Republic

The revolution that ended the fourth era gave rise to the Modern Republic. A contemporary, standardized form of Dwarvish became the Common language instead of Elvish; the human-like and beast races were also required to use the Dwarvish alphabet when writing in their own languages, even though not all sounds could be properly pronounced with it. This has been the source of some minor friction with the Republic.

The Republic continued the goal of the Elves to stamp out demon worship. However, their task was not as great due to the work already accomplished. The main area of focus was the beast-races and their patron/matron Demon Lords, now that they were considered full citizens of the Republic.

Technology
----------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of cannons and guns. There are also magical constructs, which are mindless machines that were animated by magic.

Religion
--------
The "good" religion in Maga is monotheistic, worshipping the deity called Gora. However, Gora does not actively perform miracles, and the power of Clerics, like Magic-Users, comes from their life energy rather than a blessing from Gora. In fact, there is no physical evidence that Gora exists, but rather his existence is based on an oral tradition dating thousands of years that eventually became a written tradition and organized into churches.

However, there are a large number of "evil" religions in Maga, each serving a Demon Lord. Unlike Gora, the existence of Demon Lords is undeniable and apparent. Although the worship of the Demon Lords is forbidden culturally and legally, they all have their own share of worshippers. Demon Lords are considered evil compared to Gora, and while they generally tend to be misanthropic, some actually follow a more complex grey morality. Furthermore, all the beast races traditionally worship a patron or matron Demon Lord rather than Gora (although some do worship Gora), and have a much more positive perception of the Demon Lord they follow. Some trades also have their share of followers with a similar view as the beast races: there are merchants who worship Opulentum, and sailors who worship Nautarum, for example.

A Cleric, then, is permitted to serve a Demon Lord as a patron/matron deity, but they cannot do so openly. As stated earlier, the power of Clerics does not come from a blessing, but from their life-energy.

Demon Lords all have their own region in the land of Demonia. Demonia is located deep underground, far deeper than any mortal could possibly go. The different regions are called Baronies of Demonia. Each Lord also has their own kind of demons that fit their nature.

These are some of the major Demon Lords (feel free to make new ones):

- **Pastorum**, Patron of Ghosts (worshipped by Corvidines). His demons are called Nonces, which are the ghosts of deceased sentient races. Upon death, a Nonce retains the memories of its life, but loses its sense of identity. His Barony is called Arcadia, a land of rolling hills and meadows that are perpetually lit by moonlight. His appearance is of a human skeleton in a robe, with the skull of a bull. In one hand he holds a shepherd's crook, and in the other hand he holds a box lantern.
- **Umbrarum**, Matron of Shadows (worshipped by Vespertines). Her demons are, likewise, called Shadows, which are incorporeal manifestations of darkness. Her Barony is called The Silent Vale, and is a large grassland where it is always night, lacking even a moon and only lit by the stars. Her appearance is that of a woman with pitch black skin, wearing a garment that is equally dark and featureless. She has on her belt a dagger, and holds a longbow with a quiver of arrows on her back.
- **Solum**, Matron of Purity (worshipped by Felidines). Her demons are called Zegnas, which appear as human beings with featureless, alabaster white skin, and the wings of doves. Solum's Barony is called The Sunpeaks, which are a white rocky terrain where there is always sunlight. Her appearance is simply that of a giant Zegna, dressed in a suit of steel armor and a white cape, holding a longsword in her right hand and a round shield in her left hand.
- **Vitarum**, Matron of the Woods (worshipped by Lacertines). Her demons are called Ursoths, which appear like ordinary, slightly larger than normal bears. However, Ursoths are intelligent and can speak. Vitarum's Barony is called the Twilight Pines, a tremendous pine forest with trees so high the sun is always eclipsed. Her Barony is home to a large number of animals we would recognize, and also many we would not. Her appearance is that of a woman wearing the attire of a priestess. She holds a tall staff that looks like a living tree branch with leaves still attached. On her belt is an apothecary satchel.
- **Primarium**, Patron of Disaster. His demons are called Elementals, which are intelligent beings made of fire, water, air, or earth. His Barony is called Tormentia, a region where the land never sits still. There are constant earthquakes and landslides, incredible gusts and lightning, and tremendous fires and tsunamis. His appearance is as chaotic as his domain: he is a mixture of flames, water, wind, and rock. He does not hold a constant shape, but typically presents himself as humanoid.
- **Morborum**, Patron of Plague
- **Opulentum**, Patron of Deals
- **Nautarum**, Matron of the Seas
- **Terror**, Patron of Fear. His demons are called Angstworms, which are worm-like creatures as large as an alligator and with reptilian hide. Angstworms have no head, face, or eyes, although they do have a mouth with sharp teeth. Terror's Barony is called The Void Realms, and is made of large rocks floating in space. The Angstworms are able to fly and move around freely in this medium. It is possible for a human to fall off one of the rocks and into an abyss. Terror's appearance is that of a deformed man, with tentacles coming from random parts of his body, and one eye completely overtaken by a large tumor. Slime pours from his mouth. To some extent he is a shapeshifter, but all of his forms are equally horrible.
- **Nefastum**, Matron of Thuggery
- **Ultimatum**, Patron of the End Times

Races/Species
-------------
Aside from the four human-like races (Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans), there are four beast races: Lacertines (lizard people), Felidines (cat people), Corvidines (crow people), and Vespertines (bat people). Because the four non-beast races already have details in the BFRPG rules, they are mainly described in terms of their political relationships. The beast races have full descriptions for player characters.

Note that Lizard Men do not exist in this setting (being redundant with the existence of Lacertines); in cases where you would encounter Lizard Men, instead you encounter hostile Lacertines (or non-hostile, depending on the context).

### Dwarves

Politically, Dwarves are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Elven Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the Electorate. Their rule is heavy-handed, but not outrageously so to most citizens of Maga who know of the horror stories from the Elven Kingdoms. Due to their political status, Dwarves have somewhat of a privileged position in society, which some other races are wary of.

### Elves

While the Dwarves are celebrated in Maga, the Elves are shunned. Once ruling several glorious kingdoms during the Fourth Era, known as the Elven Kingdoms, since the revolution they have been completely disgraced. The Elven Kingdoms were famous for their cruelty towards non-Elves, and their numerous violent purges of Demon Lord worship. Although few Elves today were even alive during that time, the actions of the past still haunt them. Only the few descendants of those Elves who rebelled are in the Electorate, making less than 1%. Most Elves simply want to move on with life, but others long for the day of their return to rule.

Elves have a much shorter lifespan in Maga than in the BFRPG rules: 300 to 400 years is typical.

### Halflings

Along with Humans, the Halflings occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves. They assisted with the overthrow of the Elven Kingdoms, but did not play a central role. Halflings occupy around 20% of the Electorate, and have their own political interests. The Halflings have mainly contributed economically in the role of farmers, although there are a few Halfling traders as well.

### Humans

Humans occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves, but not in the same way as Halflings. While the Halflings are notable for being generally benign during the revolution, Humans are notable for taking the extremes on both sides: some of the greatest heroes of the revolution, and greatest villains loyal to the Kingdoms, were Human. As a result, Humans manage to occupy around 30% of the Electorate. Their role in society is complicated by the fact that Humans held a relatively high regard in the Elven Kingdoms, being seen as greater than the other non-Elf races, although nowhere near the position of Elves. Some Humans think that life was better for them before the Republic, and seek to restore the Kingdoms back to their former glory.

### Lacertines

**Description:** The Lacertines are semi-aquatic humanoids descended from lizards. They have a reputation for being thoughtful and independent, but also lazy and selfish. Their unique ancestry allows them to hold their breath comfortably for around 30 minutes if necessary. They are not as naturally social as the other races, and generally keep to small tribes at the largest. While some have adapted to civilization, it is a struggle for their nature.

**Restrictions:** Lacertines may become any single class. They are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9, and a maximum Charisma of 17 due to their solitary tendencies.

**Special Abilities:** Lacertines are able to hold their breath for 30 minutes at a time comfortably. They can continue for another 5 minutes with discomfort, after which they will take damage like an ordinary Human. Because of their natural claws, unarmed melee attacks deal 1d4 damage, and may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Lacertines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, and +3 at Paralysis or Petrify.

### Felidines

**Description:** The Felidines are humanoids descended from large cats. They have a reputation for being stealthy and curious, but also aloof and cowardly. They are especially nimble and cunning, and make excellent thieves or scouts. Like the other beast races, they hold a lesser position in Maga society.

**Restrictions:** Felidines may become Fighters, Magic-Users or Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9, and a maximum Wisdom of 17 due to their natural impulsiveness.

**Special Abilities:** Felidines have Darkvision within a 60' range. Furthermore, their stealth allows them to have only a 10% chance of being detected when in the forest, or a 30% chance in other terrain. Their natural claws give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Felidines save at +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Corvidines

**Description:** Corvidines are humanoids descended from crows, but have lost the ability to fly due to their size. They have a reputation for being wise and crafty, but also grim and mysterious. Their association with death is compounded by their relationship to their patron deity, Pastorum. They are relatively frail due to their weaker bones from their bird ancestry.

**Restrictions:** Corvidines may become Clerics, Magic-Users or Thieves. They can also multi-class a Magic-User and Thief. They are required to have a minimum Wisdom of 9, and a maximum Constitution of 17 due to their natural fragility. Corvidines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class.

**Special Abilities:** Corvidines have an uncanny knowledge of secrecy, and can find hidden doors on 1-2 on 1d6 rather than 1. They also have a 1 on 1d6 chance of discovering a secret door on a cursory look. Their natural talons give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Corvidines save at +3 against Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells.

### Vespertines

![vespertine.png](vespertine.png)

**Description:** Vespertines are a small humanoid beast race descended from bats that lost their ability to fly due to their size. They tend to be between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh between 60 and 90 pounds. Their fur is usually brown, grey, or black, though white fur is not unheard of. They always have black beady eyes. Vespertines live in large tribal communities, and usually make their homes in caves in the middle of rainforests. Vespertine communities are sometimes hostile, but always in self-defense and not aggressively.

Vespertines have an omnivorous diet of insects and fruit. Vespertines tend to dress plainly, in cloth or leather. Vespertines reach adulthood at 10 years, and have a lifespan of between 30 and 40 years.

Vespertines speak their own language, Vespertinean, and most know Common. Vespertines do not tend toward any particular class, and generally prefer to use diplomacy before entering combat. They are varied in their skills, having capable fighters, clerics, magic-users, and thieves among them. Vespertines have a reputation for being cheerful and sociable, but also sometimes disloyal and scheming.

**Restrictions:** Vespertines may become any single class, as well as Fighter/Magic-Users and Magic-User/Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Charisma of 9, and a maximum Strength of 17 due to their small stature. Vespertines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class. Vespertines may not use Large weapons, and must hold Medium weapons with both hands.

**Special Abilities:** Vespertines can use sonar to "see" in total darkness, which mechanically works like 60' of Darkvision. Also, Vespertines have the ability to create a shrill noise in a line for a 100' range, dealing 1d4 points of damage to any creatures on that line.

**Saving Throws:** Vespertines save at +1 against Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify and Spells.

Classes
-------
Any race/class combination is possible for NPCs, including multi-classing. It is up to the DM whether to limit the players in this way. In particular, Fighter/Magic-Users are common in Maga among Dwarves and Humans, and Magic-Users are common among Halflings.

Magic
-----
Magic comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, it is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very secretive. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power.

Magic-Users and Clerics do not use the default system of magic in BFRPG. Instead, they use a magic point system as in the Sorcerer class, which is available as a supplement on the BFRPG website. However, they learn spells in the same way as a Magic-User or Cleric (respectively). Also, the DM may opt for the default system in BFRPG to simplify mechanics, while acknowledging that is a simplification and not a representation of how magic actually works.

Raise Dead and Reincarnate still work as per the BFRPG rules, however doing so may raise the anger of Pastorum, who expected a new ghost to serve him. Therefore, bringing people back to life is uncommon and taboo in Maga, but still possible if they died recently and not of old age.

Animate Dead for use as mindless minions such as zombies or skeletons is considered necromancy in Maga, which is outlawed. Note that Magic-Users and Clerics are still *able* to do so, but not in the open.

Some spells are tweaked to make more sense in the setting:

- **Detect Evil** becomes **Detect Demonic**: The spell is only useful for detecting the presence of demons and demonic powers; it has nothing to do with evil intentions. The reverse is **Detect Anti-Demonic**. The exact same principle applies to **Protection from Evil** becoming **Protection from Demonic** (reverse **Protection from Anti-Demonic**), and **Dispel Evil** becoming **Dispel Demonic**. Note that undead creatures in particular are not considered demonic (though they are magical). Anti-Demonic objects are ones that are imbued with the power to cause great harm to demons.

- **Commune** does not contact a patron deity; instead it contacts a particular Demon Lord, or at least a servant demon if the Lord is not available. The Demon Lord must be willing to talk to the Cleric for the spell to work, however.

- **Conjure Elemental** summons one of Primarium's demons to fight for you. Elementals are all Primarium's servants, but when you summon one it is under your control.

Language
--------
The languages are the same as per the BFRPG rules, there are some changes in the significance however. "Common" is actually a modern dialect of the Dwarvish language, and "Dwarvish" refers to an ancient, no longer used dialect.

Dwarvish, Halfling, Elvish, and Common all use the Dwarvish alphabet.

These are the additional racial languages:
- Lacertinean, the language of Lacertines and Troglodytes (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Felidinean, the language of Felidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Corvidinean, the language of Corvidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Vespertinean, the language of Vespertines (Dwarvish alphabet)

More exotic languages:
- Demonic, the language of Demons (Demonic alphabet)
- Dragonish, the language of Dragons (Demonic alphabet)
- Goblinish, the language of Goblins (and Hobgoblins, etc.) (Orcish alphabet)
- Giantish, the language of Giants (Demonic alphabet)
- Gnomish, the language of Gnomes (Orcish alphabet)
- Orcish, the language of Orcs, Gnolls, Kobolds, Ogres, and Trolls (Orcish alphabet)
- Sylvish, the language of Dryads, Spriggans, Treants, and other forest spirits (Demonic alphabet)
