The Isles of Maga
=================
The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, but here is what is common knowledge. The date of this information is 5E308 (the 308th year of the fifth era).

Physical Geography
------------------
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area of nearly one million square kilometers (approximately the size of Kazakhstan) and contains thousands of islands if not more. The islands all have a tropical climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat between subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and severity of their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of Magathos has a mountain range called the Otris Mountains, the peaks of which are tall enough to be snow-capped. As a result of the difference of elevation, this island has alpine grasslands, forests, and tundra.

The Isles of Maga are in the Sunbound Ocean, far away from any mainland continent, although some exist. Historically there has been trade with the closest mainland in the west, called Honstrad, but in recent history travel has been cut off.

Political Geography
-------------------
Maga is governed by the Modern Republic. Clusterings of islands form a district; the district that gets the most attention in this document is the Capital District, which contains the capital and nearby islands.

The capital of the country is Thronerock, located in the Otris Mountains in Magathos. Other cities in Magathos are Honuda, Grostine, Ledalia, and Sorrowport. Nearby major islands are Veldoth, Ruzark, Eyedea, Northsky, Olivon, Hosland, Brightwater, and Shaleport. Each island has at least one port city, which is the center of most trade. The cities on Magathos also have a significant inland trade.

Magathos has an area of 5,000 square kilometers, and is the largest island in Maga. The other islands listed vary in size, and are anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 square kilometers. There are other important trade islands that are much smaller, being no more than 100 or so square kilometers.

Although the inside of the Otris Mountains are very developed by Dwarves, the outside of the mountains have not largely been touched by civilization. A great number of unique wildlife make their homes there, as well as some unintegrated beast races.

Political System
----------------
The Modern Republic has a president as head of state. The representatives are chosen by the Electorate, who are the descendants of the revolutionaries who violently overthrew the Elven Kingdoms that preceded the Republic. The majority of the Electorate are Dwarves, with a significant minority of Humans and Halflings. Elves represent a very small minority of the Electorate; less than 1% are Elves, who are the descendants of those Elves that rebelled against their own kingdom. None of the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) have any members in the Electorate. As of 5E308, the president is Grulth Skullstone, an elderly Dwarf who personally participated in the establishing of the Republic in a minor role.

Technology and Magic
--------------------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of cannons and guns. There are also magical constructs, which are mindless machines that were animated by magic.

Magic comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, it is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very secretive. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power.

Religion
--------
The "good" religion in Maga is monotheistic, worshipping the deity called Gora. However, Gora does not actively perform miracles, and the power of clerics comes from their faith itself rather than an actual blessing from Gora. In fact, there is no physical evidence that Gora exists, but rather his existence is based on an oral tradition dating thousands of years that eventually became a written tradition and organized into churches.

However, there are a large number of "evil" religions in Maga, each serving a Demon Lord. Unlike Gora, the existence of Demon Lords is undeniable and apparent. Although the worship of the Demon Lords is forbidden culturally and legally, they all have their own share of worshippers. Demon Lords are considered evil compared to Gora, and while they generally tend to be misanthropic, some actually follow a more complex grey morality. Furthermore, all the beast races traditionally worship a patron or matron Demon Lord rather than Gora (although some do worship Gora), and have a much more positive perception of the Demon Lord they follow. Some trades also have their share of followers with a similar view as the beast races: there are merchants who worship Opulentum, and sailors who worship Nautarum, for example.

Demon Lords all have their own plane of existance, called the Demonic Planes. Each Lord also has their own kind of demons that fit their nature.

These are some of the major Demon Lords (feel free to make new ones):

- Pastorum, Patron of Ghosts
- Umbrarum, Matron of Shadows (worshipped by Vespertines and Corvidines)
- Solum, Matron of Purity (worshipped by Felidines)
- Vitarum, Matron of Nature (worshipped by Lacertines)
- Morborum, Patron of Plague
- Opulentum, Patron of Deals
- Nautarum, Matron of the Seas
- Terror, Patron of Fear
- Ultimatum, Patron of the End Times

Races/Species
-------------
Aside from the four human-like races (Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans), there are four beast races: Lacertines (lizard people), Felidines (cat people), Corvidines (crow people), and Vespertines (bat people). Because the four non-beast races already have details in the BFRPG rules, they are mainly described in terms of their political relationships.

### Dwarves

Politically, Dwarves are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Elven Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the Electorate. Their rule is harsh and heavy-handed, but not outrageously so. Due to their political status, Dwar
