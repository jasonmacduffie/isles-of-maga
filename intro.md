Introduction
============
For new players, this contains the most critical information necessary to understand the setting.

- **History:** Maga is an island chain, with each island typically being 500 square miles in area (an 8-hour walk from coast to coast). Humans, Halflings, Elves, and Dwarves are not native to Maga, but colonized it long ago from the continent of Honstrad. The Elves took over Maga and established many kingdoms. There was a revolution, and now the Modern Republic governs Maga. The beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) are also considered citizens now, although they do not have a say in national politics. They can participate in local politics however.

- **Religion:** The only recognized religion is monotheistic, the worship of Gora. There are however cultists that worship Demon Lords, who occupy the realm of Demonia (actually a location deep underground).

- **Cosmology:** There is only one plane of existence, the physical universe that the world of Agreus occupies. There are, however, alternate timelines that can be traversed to some degree. Magic is also a physical force, coming from an individual's life-energy.

- **Nativists:** The natives of the islands include Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres, who will attack Republican towns to reclaim their land. They are not evil, but will generally attack Republican races.

- **Mages Guild:** Arcane magic is illegal except for members of the Mages Guild. Members are required to report magical findings to the guild in order to maintain membership.

Races
-----
- **Humans:** Humans enjoyed some degree of privilege under the Elven Kingdoms, though not as high as the Elves. Many Humans supported the revolution, but more than a few were loyal to the Kingdoms.

- **Dwarves:** Dwarves have a long history of conflict with the Elves, and were greatly oppressed under the Kingdoms. They were the ones who lead the revolution, and now have the greatest sway in the Republic.

- **Elves:** After centuries out of power, the Elves have been disgraced. Although most accept the Republic and want to move one, there are a number of monarchists attempting to revive the old Elven Kingdoms.

- **Halflings:** Halflings participated in the revolution to increase the influence of the Thieves Guild in Maga, which has a disproportionate number of Halfling members. There are many legendary pirates and bandits that were Halflings.

- **Beast-Races:** The beast-races, although citizens, do not enjoy much political power and are treated as second-class citizens. Many are only partially integrated with the Republic, and still live in their tribal communities.
