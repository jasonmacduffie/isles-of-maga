Races/Species
=============
There are nine races with citizenship in the Republic: Bulgars, Kelts, Vedes, Westforts, Magfel, Noctfel, Rubefel, Lacertines and Felidines.

Note that there are no race/class restrictions whatsoever, at least from a lore perspective. The GM is free to restrict players in this manner, but there is no inherent reason why any race cannot become any class.

Men, Elves, and Orves are all members of the same species and are fully capable of conception. However, such crosses are very strongly prohibited by social stigma. Rules are not given for multiple race characters (there would be too many combinations) but they do exist.

Races of Men
------------

### Bulgars

Bulgars use the BFRPG rules for Dwarves.

Politically, the stout Bulgars are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Magfeli Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the electorate.

In Honstrad, the Bulgars hail from the land of Cyrilia, adjacent to Autumn Marsh in the west. The Magfeli empire that ruled the Rich Coast and Autumn Marsh also controlled western Cyrilia, leading to a series of conflicts between the Bulgars and Magfel that are remembered to this day.

#### Names

Bulgaric names are often analogous to Magfeli names, but written closer to their native way of speaking.

Common male names: Aleksey, Andrei, Boris, Dmitri, Fyodor, Isaak, Ivan, Mikhail, Nikolai, Pavel, Pyotr, Sergey, Viktor, Vladmir

Common female names: Anna, Darya, Fanya, Katarina, Natalia, Olga, Polina, Sasha, Svetlana, Tamara, Tatyana, Vera, Veronika, Zoya

### Kelts

Kelts use the BFRPG rules for Halflings.

The small and nimble Kelts are famous for their lawless tendencies. That is not to say all Kelts have criminal natures, but lawful Kelts have a reputation to overcome. The most famous pirates, brigands, and thieves have been Kelt individuals. Part of why the Kelts assisted in the overthrow of the Magfeli Kingdoms was based on the belief that doing so would increase the influence of the Thieves Guild, that was not permitted to flourish under the Magfel. Their estimation turned out to be basically correct.

On Honstrad, the Kelts lived along the coastline adjacent to the Magfel in the region called the Rich Coast, which they called Miniheim. For most of their history there, they have been under the rule of the Magfel empire that existed there with few uprisings. However, they never had a strong loyalty to the Magfel but wished to avoid the endless war that had resulted from the constant conflict between the Dwarves and Elves.

### Vedes

Vedes use the BFRPG rules for Humans.

The Vedes were at one point entirely enslaved as a race by the Draculs, but were able to forcibly overthrow their masters and form their own homeland in the isolated Rocky Mountains on Honstrad. From the Dracul, the Vedes learned a great deal about magic. Among the races of Men, the Vedes are well-known as spellcasters. The Vedes were unfortunately attacked by the Draculs multiple times later, forcing them to live as nomads roaming across Honstrad.

##### Names

Common male names: Abdul, Ahmad, Badawi, Ezzat, Halim, Hoda, Hussain, Ibn, Mohamed, Omar, Tawfiq, Tayeb, Yusuf, Zakaria

Common female names: Ayse, Azmiye, Elif, Fatma, Fawziyya, Halide, Hoda, Laila, Mai, Mona, Raja, Sabiha, Samira, Zeynep

#### Westforts

The Westforts have long lived in the center of Honstrad, with a long history of interaction with the Bulgars, Magfel, and Kelts. They have a long history of sailing, but mainly on seas rather than ocean travel. Westforts are also natural fighters, and are hardened from many wars to defend the strategic position of their homeland, Avodan, on the continent of Honstrad. In fact, the most common greeting among Westforts is "saker bat" literally meaning "good fight", wishing the person to fare well in battle.

##### Names

Westfort names are largely influenced by Magfeli names.

Common male names: Andre, Antoine, Ashanti, Darnell, DeAndre, DeShawn, Jamal, Malik, Marquis, Tyrone, Wayne, Xavier

Common female names: Chantelle, Isis, Jada, Jasmine, Kayla, Kizzy, Layla, Makayla, Qiana, Shaniqua, Raven, Trinity

Races of Fel
------------

All races of Fel use the BFRPG stats for Elves. Elves have a much shorter lifespan in Maga than in the BFRPG rules: 300 to 400 years is typical.

#### Magfel

The Magfel, or High Elves, have the greatest influence on Magan culture. They are the aristocracy of the former Elven Kingdoms that ruled over Maga, and have a natural talent for diplomacy and politics. Magfel are not as good in physical combat as Rubefel or Noctfel, but are much more talented in magic.

On Honstrad, they controlled an empire that controlled their homeland of Autumn Marsh as well as the Rich Coast and part of Cyrilia. There were constant wars between the Magfel and the Dwarves over control over the western portions of Cyrilia.

##### Names

Common male names: Anthony, Augustus, Clementine, Columbus, Draconis, Ignacius, Julius, Justin, Lucius, Marcelo, Pontius, Titus

Common female names: April, Bellatrix, Celina, Cornelia, Diane, Felicia, Lucille, Madonna, Matrona, Natalia, Octavia, Patricia

#### Rubefel

The Rubefel, or Wood Elves, tend to shy away from cities and prefer to live in tribes in the woods. While some have integrated into society, it is not uncommon for a Rubefel born and raised in the city to begin wandering into the woods for longer and longer hunting trips, until one day the Rubefel never returns. Traditional Rubefeli culture is very different from Magfeli culture, completely forbidding the consumption of plants and instead consuming only meat. While some keep these traditions, the Rubefel in Maga are less attached to their old traditions after eras away from Honstrad.

On Honstrad, they stayed away from civilization, instead living largely in the forests undisturbed. The home of the Rubefel is Netherwood, which is a vast forest of giant trees located southwest of Avodan. The reason for their relative isolation is due to the inhospitability of the forest; anyone attempting to tame the plantlife of Netherwood receives quick retaliation from the forest itself.

#### Noctfel

The Noctfel, or Dark Elves, are naturally accustomed to the cold, making Maga rather unhospitable to them. They originate in the distant northern land of Frostgard, where they had a large boating and fishing tribal culture. Like the Rubefel, the Noctfel of Maga have not universally kept their traditions alive, but still distinguish themselves culturally from Magfel and Rubefel. In particular, in their interpretations of Goraism, there is often a central theme of ancestor worship that is a sanitized version of their past of serving the Demon Lord Pastorum in Honstrad.

Frostgard is a great distance away from the rest of civilization on Honstrad, leaving the Noctfel to develop their society on their own. Unlike the races on the main continent, they did not develop the same taboos regarding Demon Worship, although they recognized that there are "good" Demon Lords and "bad" Demon Lords based on the tendency of their domain. Pastorum worship was the main form of Demon Worship practiced by the Noctfel, and even today in Maga there are occasionally some Noctfel that keep their ancient ways.

Lacertines
----------
**Description:** The Lacertines are semi-aquatic humanoids descended from lizards. They have a reputation for being thoughtful and independent, but also lazy and selfish. Their unique ancestry allows them to hold their breath comfortably for around 30 minutes if necessary. They are not as naturally social as the other races, and generally keep to small tribes at the largest. While some have adapted to civilization, it is a struggle for their nature.

Lacertines have a long history of magic use, having learned to cast spells from the dragons native to Maga. There is a separate order of Lacertine magicians independent from the Mages Guild.

**Restrictions:** Lacertines are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9, and a maximum Charisma of 17 due to their solitary tendencies.

**Special Abilities:** Lacertines are able to hold their breath for 30 minutes at a time comfortably. They can continue for another 5 minutes with discomfort, after which they will take damage like an ordinary Human. Because of their natural claws, unarmed melee attacks deal 1d4 damage, and may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Lacertines save at +5 at Death Ray or Poison, +4 at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Lacertinean is composed of fewer sounds than Commons. Here is approximately their alphabet:

D,L,N,S,T,TH,Z

There is only a single generic vowel in Lacertinean, sometimes denoted by "E" when necessary but also left out sometimes. Here are examples of Lacertine names with the vowel:

- Lenedeth
- Zesteth
- Thedent
- Tenthez
- Sezeth
- Nesteth

Felidines
---------
**Description:** The Felidines are humanoids descended from large cats. They have a reputation for being stealthy and curious, but also aloof and cowardly. They are especially nimble and cunning, and make excellent thieves or scouts. Like the other beast races, they hold a lesser position in Maga society.

**Restrictions:** Felidines are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9, and a maximum Wisdom of 17 due to their natural impulsiveness.

**Special Abilities:** Felidines have Darkvision within a 60' range. Furthermore, their stealth allows them to have only a 10% chance of being detected when in the forest, or a 30% chance in other terrain. Their natural claws give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Felidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Felidines use a wide variety of vocalizations that cannot be accessed by other races. This means there is a severe transformation in traditional names to something pronounceable by other races. The vocalizations are:

- Purr (denoted by r)
- Meow (denoted by m, followed by a vowel)
- Hiss (denoted by s)
- Huff (denoted by h)
- Chirp (denoted by ch, followed by a vowel)

Here are examples of names:

- Rumiaschi
- Chasisi
- Harascha
- Sachara
- Miascha
- Mirmia

Corvidines
----------
**Description:** Corvidines are humanoids descended from crows, but have lost the ability to fly due to their size. They have a reputation for being wise and crafty, but also grim and mysterious. Their association with death is compounded by their relationship to their patron deity, Pastorum. They are relatively frail due to their weaker bones from their bird ancestry.

**Restrictions:** Corvidines are required to have a minimum Wisdom of 9, and a maximum Constitution of 17 due to their natural fragility. Corvidines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class.

**Special Abilities:** Corvidines have an uncanny knowledge of secrecy, and can find hidden doors on 1-2 on 1d6 rather than 1. They also have a 1 on 1d6 chance of discovering a secret door on a cursory look. Their natural talons give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Corvidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Corvidines are the most difficult names to translate, because their language is largely communicated through bird songs with few consonants. However, over the ages they have developed names that continue a cultural distinction while being available to other races to pronounce. Here are some typical names:

- Korooko
- Frookoo
- Kawrook
- Badoot
- Zooka
- Daboota

Vespertines
-----------
![vespertine.png](vespertine.png)

**Description:** Vespertines are a small humanoid beast race descended from bats that lost their ability to fly due to their size. They tend to be between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh between 60 and 90 pounds. Their fur is usually brown, grey, or black, though white fur is not unheard of. They always have black beady eyes. Vespertines live in large tribal communities, and usually make their homes in caves in the middle of rainforests. Vespertine communities are sometimes hostile, but always in self-defense and not aggressively.

Vespertines have an omnivorous diet of insects and fruit. Vespertines tend to dress plainly, in cloth or leather. Vespertines reach adulthood at 10 years, and have a lifespan of between 30 and 40 years.

Vespertines speak their own language, Vespertinean, and most know Common. Vespertines do not tend toward any particular class, and generally prefer to use diplomacy before entering combat. They are varied in their skills, having capable fighters, clerics, magic-users, and thieves among them. Vespertines have a reputation for being cheerful and sociable, but also sometimes disloyal and scheming.

**Restrictions:** Vespertines are required to have a minimum Charisma of 9, and a maximum Strength of 17 due to their small stature. Vespertines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class. Vespertines may not use Large weapons, and must hold Medium weapons with both hands.

**Special Abilities:** Vespertines can use sonar to "see" in total darkness, which mechanically works like 60' of Darkvision. Also, Vespertines have the ability to create a shrill noise in a line for a 100' range, dealing 1d4 points of damage to any creatures on that line.

**Saving Throws:** Vespertines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Vespertinean is composed of chirp-like vocalizations. Their alphabet is difficult to reproduce in our language, but approximately their language has these sounds:

A,B,BL,CH,D,I,K,PR,SP,T,TW

Vowels are often times elongated, noted by three repeating vowels. Other races can ignore the elongation and still be understood.

Examples of names could be:

- Adikprit
- Twiblitriii
- Blidkit
- Priblid
- Chitwiiik
- Kiblaaachi

Okros
-------

Most nativists belong to the same larger race of Okros, containing Orcs, Goblins, Gnomes, and Ogres. Okros do not exist in Honstrad, having always lived in Maga.

### Orcs

Unlike many other settings, Orcs are not inherently bent on domination as a species. As a culture, however, a great deal of their social customs have developed from a spirit of war and conquest. Historically, the various Orc tribes would fight against each other. Today, they use their warrior spirit to battle against the Republic that claims their lands.

It would also be incorrect to paint Orcs are merely misunderstood. They are perhaps the most aggressive of the intelligent races, and most likely to reject surrender, retreat, or diplomacy. Their history is painted with war, and they are known to have subjugated all of the other Nativist races in a powerful civilization before the colonization began.

Also, Orcs are more likely to form relationships with humans than in other settings. Although it is still unlikely given the political turmoil involved, there have been a number of Half-Orcs born under loving relationships. However, these children are destined to be completely unintegrated both in Republican society, as well as Orcish society, and potentially attacked by either one.

Orcs are better smiths than Dwarves, and smithing is a sacred art in Orcish culture. Since before the recipe for gunpowder was perfected, Orcs were already making attempts to develop a personal firearm. Right now Orcs are able to manufacture cannons and personal firearms of higher quality than what is available in the Republic.

Orcish family name depends on the gender of the individual. A male will have the surname of his father prefixed by "kor-" and a female will have the surname of her mother prefixed by "kar-". For example, a male Orc may be named Bazgul kor-Gogrin and his sister may be named Ogash kar-Lorok.

### Goblins

Goblins are about as intelligent as Orcs, and have a very close history with them. They are the most likely of Nativist races to join them in arms, and the most integrated in Orcish society. However, they still represent a lower social caste than Orcs. Advanced Goblins, such as Hobgoblins, are of particular intelligence and skill, and make for warriors that are a match for Orcs. Although Goblins have their own culture and tradition separate from Orcs, the influence of Orcish society has been overwhelming and to some degree Goblin society has influenced Orcish culture.

Goblins originally lived underground, and many still do. However after the Orcish civilization controlled Maga they tended to live above ground.

### Gnomes

Gnomes are a subrace of Okros, and have much more monstrous features than other settings. They appear to have physical traits of both Halflings and Goblins. They are much more magically inclined than other Okros.

Gnomes generally have blue hair.

### Ogres

Ogres form small clans, but are far less social and civilized than the Orcs. They tend to live in the woods, caves, or vacant ruins rather than to construct their own buildings. They are aggressive in a territorial way, but do not actively engage in battle with the Republic unless sided with an Orc tribe. They are not intelligent enough to understand the complex politics involved, and just tend to side with Orcs because of their historical connection under the Orcish empire.

Non-Colonist Honstrad Races
---------------------------
These races exist in the world of Agreus, but did not join the colonization and are not native to Maga.

### Giants

Giants were already an uncommon sight on Honstrad, but in Maga they are nearly unknown with the exception of Cyclopses and Hill Giants.

### Draculs

Draculs are a race of humanoid, human-sized dragons without wings. They look somewhat like Lacertines, but with the color scales of their parent dragon, and more built. Draculs have different colored scales depending on what kind of dragon they descend from. They also have a tendency to inherit the personality of dragons, such as sassiness and hoarding behavior. Draculs lived in Honstrad but did not colonize Maga, and are not native to Maga. For this reason, you are unlikely to meet a Dracul unless it had come from Honstrad recently.

On Honstrad, most Draculs lived in their homeland of Grey Mountain, a huge volcanic mountain containing a dragon they collectively worshipped.

### Iavols

Iavols are a race a humanoids with devilish features. Like the Draculs the Iavols had their own kingdoms on Honstrad but are not generally found in Maga.

On Honstrad, the homeland of the Iavols was the Sunrise Isles. Unlike most other races, but like the Noctfel, the Iavols were serious demon worshippers. The primary Demon Lord worshipped by the Iavols was Solum, and the Iavols were harshly concerned with Solum's extreme view of justice and fair punishment.

### Mechanids

Mechanids are ancient constructs made of metal, kept alive by magic that is long forgotten. However, there were never Mechanids in Maga, so any that you encounter almost certainly arrived from Honstrad recently. Even though Mechanids have intelligence on the level of a human being, they are still highly goal-oriented and do not have "free will" in a sense we would easily recognize. A Mechanid cannot simple "overcome" its reason for existing. One of the dangers of Mechanids is that some were created for war, and continue to fight for their nations despite the fact that their constructors perished long ago. Because nobody knows how to construct Mechanids, and their ancient constructors are not from Maga, you are very unlikely to encounter a Mechanid although one or two may be around somewhere. Most people do not know what a Mechanid is, and will not recognize one upon sight.

Mechanids recharge themselves magically, much like a self-recharging wand. They are able to cast spells, but unlike living creatures they do not use their "life-energy" but instead their internally stored magical charge. This does not have any impact on gameplay. On the other hand, Mechanids are also unable to heal naturally and organically in the way other living things are able to. This means resting does not heal a Mechanid, and instead one would need to see an expert on machinery to heal a Mechanid.
