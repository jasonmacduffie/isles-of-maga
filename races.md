Races/Species
=============
There are nine races with citizenship in the Republic: Bulgars, Kelts, Vedes, Westforts, Magfel, Noctfel, Rubefel, Lacertines and Felidines.

Note that there are no race/class restrictions whatsoever, at least from a lore perspective. The GM is free to restrict players in this manner, but there is no inherent reason why any race cannot become any class.

Men, Elves, and Orves are all members of the same species and are fully capable of conception. However, such crosses are very strongly prohibited by social stigma. Rules are not given for multiple race characters (there would be too many combinations) but they do exist.

Races of Men
------------

### Bulgars

Bulgars use the BFRPG rules for Dwarves.

Politically, the stout Bulgars are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Magfeli Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the electorate.

In Honstrad, the Bulgars hail from the land of Cyrilia, adjacent to Autumn Marsh in the west. The Magfeli empire that ruled the Rich Coast and Autumn Marsh also controlled western Cyrilia, leading to a series of conflicts between the Bulgars and Magfel that are remembered to this day.

#### Names

Bulgaric names are often analogous to Magfeli names, but written closer to their native way of speaking.

Common male names: Aleksey, Andrei, Boris, Dmitri, Fyodor, Isaak, Ivan, Mikhail, Nikolai, Pavel, Pyotr, Sergey, Viktor, Vladmir

Common female names: Anna, Darya, Fanya, Katarina, Natalia, Olga, Polina, Sasha, Svetlana, Tamara, Tatyana, Vera, Veronika, Zoya

### Kelts

Kelts use the BFRPG rules for Halflings.

The small and nimble Kelts are famous for their lawless tendencies. That is not to say all Kelts have criminal natures, but lawful Kelts have a reputation to overcome. The most famous pirates, brigands, and thieves have been Kelt individuals. Part of why the Kelts assisted in the overthrow of the Magfeli Kingdoms was based on the belief that doing so would increase the influence of the Thieves Guild, that was not permitted to flourish under the Magfel. Their estimation turned out to be basically correct.

On Honstrad, the Kelts lived along the coastline adjacent to the Magfel in the region called the Rich Coast, which they called Miniheim. For most of their history there, they have been under the rule of the Magfel empire that existed there with few uprisings. However, they never had a strong loyalty to the Magfel but wished to avoid the endless war that had resulted from the constant conflict between the Dwarves and Elves.

### Vedes

Vedes use the BFRPG rules for Humans.

The Vedes were at one point entirely enslaved as a race by the Draculs, but were able to forcibly overthrow their masters and form their own homeland in the isolated Rocky Mountains on Honstrad. From the Dracul, the Vedes learned a great deal about magic. Among the races of Men, the Vedes are well-known as spellcasters. The Vedes were unfortunately attacked by the Draculs multiple times later, forcing them to live as nomads roaming across Honstrad.

##### Names

Common male names: Abdul, Ahmad, Badawi, Ezzat, Halim, Hoda, Hussain, Ibn, Mohamed, Omar, Tawfiq, Tayeb, Yusuf, Zakaria

Common female names: Ayse, Azmiye, Elif, Fatma, Fawziyya, Halide, Hoda, Laila, Mai, Mona, Raja, Sabiha, Samira, Zeynep

#### Westforts

The Westforts have long lived in the center of Honstrad, with a long history of interaction with the Bulgars, Magfel, and Kelts. They have a long history of sailing, but mainly on seas rather than ocean travel. Westforts are also natural fighters, and are hardened from many wars to defend the strategic position of their homeland, Avodan, on the continent of Honstrad. In fact, the most common greeting among Westforts is "saker bat" literally meaning "good fight", wishing the person to fare well in battle.

##### Names

Westfort names are largely influenced by Magfeli names.

Common male names: Andre, Antoine, Ashanti, Darnell, DeAndre, DeShawn, Jamal, Malik, Marquis, Tyrone, Wayne, Xavier

Common female names: Chantelle, Isis, Jada, Jasmine, Kayla, Kizzy, Layla, Makayla, Qiana, Shaniqua, Raven, Trinity

Races of Fel
------------

All races of Fel use the BFRPG stats for Elves. Elves have a much shorter lifespan in Maga than in the BFRPG rules: 300 to 400 years is typical.

#### Magfel

The Magfel, or High Elves, have the greatest influence on Magan culture. They are the aristocracy of the former Magfeli Empire that ruled over Maga, and have a natural talent for diplomacy and politics. Magfel are not as good in physical combat as Rubefel or Noctfel, but are much more talented in magic.

On Honstrad, they controlled an empire that controlled their homeland of Autumn Marsh as well as the Rich Coast and part of Cyrilia. There were constant wars between the Magfel and the Dwarves over control over the western portions of Cyrilia.

##### Names

Common male names: Anthony, Augustus, Clementine, Columbus, Draconis, Ignacius, Julius, Justin, Lucius, Marcelo, Pontius, Titus

Common female names: April, Bellatrix, Celina, Cornelia, Diane, Felicia, Lucille, Madonna, Matrona, Natalia, Octavia, Patricia

#### Rubefel

The Rubefel, or Wood Elves, tend to shy away from cities and prefer to live in tribes in the woods. While some have integrated into society, it is not uncommon for a Rubefel born and raised in the city to begin wandering into the woods for longer and longer hunting trips, until one day the Rubefel never returns. Traditional Rubefeli culture is very different from Magfeli culture, completely forbidding the consumption of plants and instead consuming only meat. While some keep these traditions, the Rubefel in Maga are less attached to their old traditions after eras away from Honstrad.

On Honstrad, they stayed away from civilization, instead living largely in the forests undisturbed. The home of the Rubefel is Netherwood, which is a vast forest of giant trees located southwest of Avodan. The reason for their relative isolation is due to the inhospitability of the forest; anyone attempting to tame the plantlife of Netherwood receives quick retaliation from the forest itself.

#### Noctfel

The Noctfel, or Dark Elves, are naturally accustomed to the cold, making Maga rather unhospitable to them. They originate in the distant northern land of Frostgard, where they had a large boating and fishing tribal culture. Like the Rubefel, the Noctfel of Maga have not universally kept their traditions alive, but still distinguish themselves culturally from Magfel and Rubefel. In particular, in their interpretations of Goraism, there is often a central theme of ancestor worship that is a sanitized version of their past of serving the Demon Lord Pastorum in Honstrad.

Frostgard is a great distance away from the rest of civilization on Honstrad, leaving the Noctfel to develop their society on their own. Unlike the races on the main continent, they did not develop the same taboos regarding Demon Worship, although they recognized that there are "good" Demon Lords and "bad" Demon Lords based on the tendency of their domain. Pastorum worship was the main form of Demon Worship practiced by the Noctfel, and even today in Maga there are occasionally some Noctfel that keep their ancient ways.

Non-Colonist Honstrad Races
---------------------------
These races exist in the world of Agreus, but did not join the colonization and are not native to Maga.

### Draculs

Draculs are a race of humanoid, human-sized dragons without wings. They look somewhat like Lacertines, but with the color scales of their parent dragon, and more built. Draculs have different colored scales depending on what kind of dragon they descend from. They also have a tendency to inherit the personality of dragons, such as sassiness and hoarding behavior. Draculs lived in Honstrad but did not colonize Maga, and are not native to Maga. For this reason, you are unlikely to meet a Dracul unless it had come from Honstrad recently.

On Honstrad, most Draculs lived in their homeland of Grey Mountain, a huge volcanic mountain containing a dragon they collectively worshipped.

### Iavols

Iavols are a race a humanoids with devilish features. Like the Draculs the Iavols had their own kingdom on Honstrad but are not generally found in Maga.

On Honstrad, the homeland of the Iavols was the Sunrise Isles. Unlike most other races, but like the Noctfel, the Iavols were serious demon worshippers. The primary Demon Lord worshipped by the Iavols was Solum, and the Iavols were harshly concerned with Solum's extreme view of justice and fair punishment.

### Mechanids

Mechanids are ancient constructs made of metal, kept alive by magic that is long forgotten. However, there were never Mechanids in Maga, so any that you encounter almost certainly arrived from Honstrad recently. Even though Mechanids have intelligence on the level of a human being, they are still highly goal-oriented and do not have "free will" in a sense we would easily recognize. A Mechanid cannot simple "overcome" its reason for existing. One of the dangers of Mechanids is that some were created for war, and continue to fight for their nations despite the fact that their constructors perished long ago. Because nobody knows how to construct Mechanids, and their ancient constructors are not from Maga, you are very unlikely to encounter a Mechanid although one or two may be around somewhere. Most people do not know what a Mechanid is, and will not recognize one upon sight.

Mechanids recharge themselves magically, much like a self-recharging wand. They are able to cast spells, but unlike living creatures they do not use their "life-energy" but instead their internally stored magical charge. This does not have any impact on gameplay. On the other hand, Mechanids are also unable to heal naturally and organically in the way other living things are able to. This means resting does not heal a Mechanid, and instead one would need to see an expert on machinery to heal a Mechanid.
