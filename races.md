Races/Species
=============
Aside from the four major races (Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans), there are four beast races: Lacertines (lizard people), Felidines (cat people), Corvidines (crow people), and Vespertines (bat people). Because the four non-beast races already have details in the BFRPG rules, they are mainly described in terms of their political relationships. The beast races have full descriptions for player characters.

It is up to the GM whether to include Lizard Men in the setting or to substitute them for Lacertines. To leave this ambiguous, no references to Lizard Men outside of Lacertines are made in these documents.

The beast races are all given some traditional names to choose from. However, many choose or are given Common or Dwarven names, depending on where they are from. Some also choose descriptive titles as a substitute for their names, such as Swift-runner (for a particularly fast individual).

Note that there are no race/class restrictions whatsoever, at least from a lore perspective. Fighter/Magic-Users are common in Maga among Dwarves and Humans, and Magic-Users are common among Halflings, for example. The GM is free to restrict players in this manner, but there is no inherent reason why any race cannot become any class.

The four main races are the same species, and are fully capable of conception. However, such crosses are very strongly prohibited by social stigma. Rules are not given for multiple race characters (there would be too many combinations) but they do exist. Note that Orcs and Ogres have a much greater genetic separation from the four main races, and are much more likely to have inviable offspring. For this reason, they are considered a different species but it is genetically possible to create a viable hybrid.

Dwarves
-------
Politically, Dwarves are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Elven Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the Electorate. Their rule is heavy-handed, but not outrageously so to most citizens of Maga who know of the horror stories from the Elven Kingdoms. Due to their political status, Dwarves have somewhat of a privileged position in society, which some other races are wary of.

Elves
-----
While the Dwarves are celebrated in Maga, the Elves are shunned. Once ruling several glorious kingdoms during the First Era, known as the Elven Kingdoms, since the revolution they have been completely disgraced. The Elven Kingdoms were famous for their cruelty towards non-Elves, and their numerous violent purges of Demon Lord worship. Although few Elves today were even alive during that time, the actions of the past still haunt them. Only the few descendants of those Elves who rebelled are in the Electorate, making less than 1%. Most Elves simply want to move on with life, but others long for the day of their return to rule.

Elves have a much shorter lifespan in Maga than in the BFRPG rules: 300 to 400 years is typical.

Halflings
---------
Along with Humans, the Halflings occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves. They assisted with the overthrow of the Elven Kingdoms, but did not play a central role. Halflings occupy around 10% of the Electorate.

Halflings in Maga have a bit of unique character to them. While in most settings they are known for being good-natured, in Maga they are much more inclined to a life of crime than the other major races. That is not to say there are not lawful Halflings, but those ones have a reputation to overcome. The most famous pirates, brigands, and thieves have been Halfling individuals. Another distinction is that while Halflings in other settings tend to live in rural areas, in Maga there tend to be more in urban settings. There are nonetheless a decent number of Halfling farmers.

Part of why Halflings assisted in the overthrow of the Elven Kingdoms was based on the belief that doing so would increase the influence of the Thieves Guild, that was not permitted to flourish under the Elves. Their estimation turned out to be basically correct.

Humans
------
Humans occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves, but not in the same way as Halflings. While the Halflings are notable for being generally benign during the revolution, Humans are notable for taking the extremes on both sides: some of the greatest heroes of the revolution, and greatest villains loyal to the Kingdoms, were Human. As a result, Humans manage to occupy around 25% of the Electorate. Their role in society is complicated by the fact that Humans held a relatively high regard in the Elven Kingdoms, being seen as greater than the other non-Elf races, although nowhere near the position of Elves. Some Humans think that life was better for them before the Republic, and seek to restore the Kingdoms back to their former glory.

Lacertines
----------
**Description:** The Lacertines are semi-aquatic humanoids descended from lizards. They have a reputation for being thoughtful and independent, but also lazy and selfish. Their unique ancestry allows them to hold their breath comfortably for around 30 minutes if necessary. They are not as naturally social as the other races, and generally keep to small tribes at the largest. While some have adapted to civilization, it is a struggle for their nature.

**Restrictions:** Lacertines are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9, and a maximum Charisma of 17 due to their solitary tendencies.

**Special Abilities:** Lacertines are able to hold their breath for 30 minutes at a time comfortably. They can continue for another 5 minutes with discomfort, after which they will take damage like an ordinary Human. Because of their natural claws, unarmed melee attacks deal 1d4 damage, and may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Lacertines save at +5 at Death Ray or Poison, +4 at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Lacertinean is composed of fewer sounds than Commons. Here is approximately their alphabet:

D,L,N,S,T,TH,Z

There is only a single generic vowel in Lacertinean, sometimes denoted by "E" when necessary but also left out sometimes. Here are examples of Lacertine names with the vowel:

- Lenedeth
- Zesteth
- Thedent
- Tenthez
- Sezeth
- Nesteth

Felidines
---------
**Description:** The Felidines are humanoids descended from large cats. They have a reputation for being stealthy and curious, but also aloof and cowardly. They are especially nimble and cunning, and make excellent thieves or scouts. Like the other beast races, they hold a lesser position in Maga society.

**Restrictions:** Felidines are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9, and a maximum Wisdom of 17 due to their natural impulsiveness.

**Special Abilities:** Felidines have Darkvision within a 60' range. Furthermore, their stealth allows them to have only a 10% chance of being detected when in the forest, or a 30% chance in other terrain. Their natural claws give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Felidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Felidines use a wide variety of vocalizations that cannot be accessed by other races. This means there is a severe transformation in traditional names to something pronounceable by other races. The vocalizations are:

- Purr (denoted by r)
- Meow (denoted by m, followed by a vowel)
- Hiss (denoted by s)
- Huff (denoted by h)
- Chirp (denoted by ch, followed by a vowel)

Here are examples of names:

- Rumiaschi
- Chasisi
- Harascha
- Sachara
- Miascha
- Mirmia

Corvidines
----------
**Description:** Corvidines are humanoids descended from crows, but have lost the ability to fly due to their size. They have a reputation for being wise and crafty, but also grim and mysterious. Their association with death is compounded by their relationship to their patron deity, Pastorum. They are relatively frail due to their weaker bones from their bird ancestry.

**Restrictions:** Corvidines are required to have a minimum Wisdom of 9, and a maximum Constitution of 17 due to their natural fragility. Corvidines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class.

**Special Abilities:** Corvidines have an uncanny knowledge of secrecy, and can find hidden doors on 1-2 on 1d6 rather than 1. They also have a 1 on 1d6 chance of discovering a secret door on a cursory look. Their natural talons give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Corvidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Corvidines are the most difficult names to translate, because their language is largely communicated through bird songs with few consonants. However, over the ages they have developed names that continue a cultural distinction while being available to other races to pronounce. Here are some typical names:

- Korooko
- Frookoo
- Kawrook
- Badoot
- Zooka
- Daboota

Vespertines
-----------
![vespertine.png](vespertine.png)

**Description:** Vespertines are a small humanoid beast race descended from bats that lost their ability to fly due to their size. They tend to be between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh between 60 and 90 pounds. Their fur is usually brown, grey, or black, though white fur is not unheard of. They always have black beady eyes. Vespertines live in large tribal communities, and usually make their homes in caves in the middle of rainforests. Vespertine communities are sometimes hostile, but always in self-defense and not aggressively.

Vespertines have an omnivorous diet of insects and fruit. Vespertines tend to dress plainly, in cloth or leather. Vespertines reach adulthood at 10 years, and have a lifespan of between 30 and 40 years.

Vespertines speak their own language, Vespertinean, and most know Common. Vespertines do not tend toward any particular class, and generally prefer to use diplomacy before entering combat. They are varied in their skills, having capable fighters, clerics, magic-users, and thieves among them. Vespertines have a reputation for being cheerful and sociable, but also sometimes disloyal and scheming.

**Restrictions:** Vespertines are required to have a minimum Charisma of 9, and a maximum Strength of 17 due to their small stature. Vespertines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class. Vespertines may not use Large weapons, and must hold Medium weapons with both hands.

**Special Abilities:** Vespertines can use sonar to "see" in total darkness, which mechanically works like 60' of Darkvision. Also, Vespertines have the ability to create a shrill noise in a line for a 100' range, dealing 1d4 points of damage to any creatures on that line.

**Saving Throws:** Vespertines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

### Typical names

Vespertinean is composed of chirp-like vocalizations. Their alphabet is difficult to reproduce in our language, but approximately their language has these sounds:

A,B,BL,CH,D,I,K,PR,SP,T,TW

Vowels are often times elongated, noted by three repeating vowels. Other races can ignore the elongation and still be understood.

Examples of names could be:

- Adikprit
- Twiblitriii
- Blidkit
- Priblid
- Chitwiiik
- Kiblaaachi

Orc-aligned Races
-----------------
These races are hostile to both the beast-races and the major races in Maga. The Orcs are not organized like the Republic, but rather have a decentralized system of tribes. In the past these tribes tended to war with each other, but as of late they have been united in spirit and aggression is directed toward the Republic that claims ownership of their lands. However, there is still not a central administration. The other races that are aligned with Orcs also precede the colonization of Maga, and share similar stake in the conflict.

### Orcs

Unlike many other settings, Orcs are not inherently bent on domination as a species. As a culture, however, a great deal of their social customs have developed from a spirit of war and conquest. Historically, the various Orc tribes would fight against each other. Today, they use their warrior spirit to battle against the Republic that claims their lands.

It would also be incorrect to paint Orcs are merely misunderstood. They are perhaps the most aggressive of the intelligent races, and most likely to reject surrender, retreat, or diplomacy. Their history is painted with war, and they are known to have subjugated all of the other Orc-aligned races in a powerful civilization before the colonization began.

Also, Orcs are more likely to form relationships with humans than in other settings. Although it is still unlikely given the political turmoil involved, there have been a number of Half-Orcs born under loving relationships. However, these children are destined to be completely unintegrated both in Republican society, as well as Orcish society, and potentially attacked by either one.

### Gnolls

Gnolls are fairly intelligent, and may be users of sword, bow, or magic depending on its individual talent. They tend to live in loosely knit tribes, similarly to Ogres but with much more organization and intelligence. Gnolls are not as integrated with Orcish society as Goblins, but some are fairly close. They tend to form separate tribes but will occasionally join Orcs in battle against the Republic.

### Goblins

Goblins are about as intelligent as Orcs, and have a very close history with them. They are the most likely of Orc-aligned races to join them in arms, and the most integrated in Orcish society. However, they still represent a lower social caste than Orcs. Advanced Goblins, such as Hobgoblins, are of particular intelligence and skill, and make for warriors that are a match for Orcs. Although Goblins have their own culture and tradition separate from Orcs, the influence of Orcish society has been overwhelming and to some degree Goblin society has influenced Orcish culture.

#### Gnomes

Gnomes are a subrace of Goblins that appear much more similar to humans, but still have more resemblance to Goblins than in other settings. They are much more magically inclined than other Goblins.

### Kobolds

Kobolds are not inherently aggressive, but will attack any races they do not trust out of concern for their own safety. They are far more intelligent and cunning than most other Orc-aligned races. They have a highly cohesive tribal structure which is outside of Orcish society, but also sometimes overlaps in areas where Kobolds have integrated. Kobolds are excellent ranged fighters and trappers.

### Ogres

Ogres form small clans, but are far less social and civilized than the Orcs. They tend to live in the woods, caves, or vacant ruins rather than to construct their own buildings. They are aggressive in a territorial way, but do not actively engage in battle with the Republic unless sided with an Orc tribe. They are not intelligent enough to understand the complex politics involved, and just tend to side with Orcs because of their historical connection under the Orcish empire.

### Trolls

Trolls do not have a warring culture like the Orcs, nor do they have a territorial nature like the Ogres. Instead, they tend to hunt the main races for the fun of the hunt. They are more animalistic than the other Orc-aligned races, but still have the ability to communicate in their own language and Orcish. Again, like the other races, their tendency to occasionally side with Orcs comes with the historical connection under the Orcish empire, and thus some are integrated well with Orcish society as warriors.

Additional Unaligned Races
--------------------------
The races here are neither Republican nor Orc-aligned.

### Draculs

Very rarely, a dragon egg will hatch a humanoid and human-sized dragon without wings, called a Dracul. They look somewhat like Lacertines, but with the color scales of their parent dragon, and more built. Draculs have a tendency to inherit the traits of dragons as well, such as sassiness and hoarding behavior. However, because they are substantially weaker than a full-size dragon, they rely much more on social relations to secure their wealth. There is an ancient legend of a powerful Orc king who was usurped by a Dracul, and the Orcs respected him for his strength. Draculs will not be recognized by most commoners, who likely never even heard of the word Dracul.

### Diabols

Diabols are the result of the corrupting influence of Seditionum, either directly from infection by a Soulhaunt or by having two Diabol parents. They are rare to the point of being legendary, and most commoners will have no idea what a Diabol is upon seeing one or will have even heard of a Diabol. They have various features typical of images of devils such as grey or red skin, horns, and tails. Diabols tend to congregate in communes dedicated to worshipping Seditionum.

### Mechanids

Mechanids are ancient constructs made of metal, kept alive by magic that is long forgotten. However, there were never Mechanids in Maga, so any that you encounter almost certainly arrived from Honstrad at some point. Even though Mechanids have intelligence on the level of a human being, they are still highly goal-oriented and do not have "free will" in a sense we would easily recognize. A Mechanid cannot simple "overcome" its reason for existing. One of the dangers of Mechanids is that some were created for war, and continue to fight for their nations despite the fact that their constructors perished long ago. Because nobody knows how to construct Mechanids, and their ancient constructors are not from Maga, you are very unlikely to encounter a Mechanid although one or two may be around somewhere. Most people do not know what a Mechanid is, and will not recognize one upon sight.

Mechanids recharge themselves magically, much like a self-recharging wand. They are able to cast spells, but unlike living creatures they do not use their "life-energy" but instead their internally stored magical charge. This does not have any impact on gameplay.
