Languages
=========
The languages are the same as per the BFRPG rules, there are some changes in the significance however. "Common" is actually a modern dialect of the Elvish language, and "Elvish" refers to a more old-fashioned dialect only used by Elves to speak to each other sometimes. Elves know both Common and old-fashioned Elvish. Furthermore, there is a language called Humanish, which Humans start out with in addition to Common.

Humanish, Dwarvish, Halfling, Elvish, and Common all use the Common alphabet (formerly the Elvish alphabet, renamed by the Republic).

These are the additional racial languages:
- Lacertinean, the language of Lacertines (Common alphabet)
- Felidinean, the language of Felidines (Common alphabet)
- Corvidinean, the language of Corvidines (Common alphabet)
- Vespertinean, the language of Vespertines (Common alphabet)

Nativist racial languages:
- Orcish, the language of Orcs, but which is commonly used by other Nativist races (Orcish alphabet)
- Gnollish, the language of Gnolls (Orcish alphabet)
- Goblinish, the language of Goblins (Orcish alphabet)
- Koboldish, the language of Kobolds (Orcish alphabet)
- Ogrish, the language of Ogres (Orcish alphabet)
- Trollish, the language of Trolls (Orcish alphabet)

More exotic languages:
- Demonic, the language of Demons (Demonic alphabet)
- Dragonish, the language of Dragons (Dragonish alphabet)
- Giantish, the language of Giants (Giantish alphabet)
