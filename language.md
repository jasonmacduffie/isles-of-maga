Languages
=========
The language rules are substantially changed compared to the BFRPG rules. Each race has its own language, plus an additional language of "Common" which is a modernized dialect of the Magfeli language, where "Magfeli" refers to a more old-fashioned dialect. Furthermore, Magic-Users begin knowing Dragonish in addition to any other languages.
