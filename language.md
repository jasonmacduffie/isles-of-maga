Languages
=========
The languages are the same as per the BFRPG rules, there are some changes in the significance however. "Common" is actually a modern dialect of the Elvish language, and "Elvish" refers to a more old-fashioned dialect only used by Elves to speak to each other sometimes. Elves know both Common and old-fashioned Elvish. Furthermore, there is a language called Humanish, which Humans start out with in addition to Common. The Halfling language is more commonly known as Minikinish.

Humanish, Dwarvish, Minikinish, Elvish, and Common all use the Common alphabet (formerly the Elvish alphabet, renamed by the Republic).

These are the additional racial languages:
- Lacertinean, the language of Lacertines (Common alphabet)
- Felidinean, the language of Felidines (Common alphabet)
- Corvidinean, the language of Corvidines (Common alphabet)
- Vespertinean, the language of Vespertines (Common alphabet)

Nativist racial languages:
- Orcish, the language of Orcs, but which is commonly used by other Nativist races (Orcish alphabet)
- Gnomish, the language of Gnomes (Orcish alphabet)
- Goblinish, the language of Goblins (Orcish alphabet)
- Ogrish, the language of Ogres (Orcish alphabet)

More exotic languages:
- Demonish, the language of Demons (Demonish alphabet)
- Dragonish, the language of Dragons (Dragonish alphabet). Magic-Users also start with knowledge of Dragonish, which is the usual language for magical texts. This is independent of any intelligence bonus.
- Giantish, the language of Giants (Giantish alphabet)
- Sylvish, the language of Dryads and Treants (Demonic alphabet)
