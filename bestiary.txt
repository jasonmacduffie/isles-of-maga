Bestiary
========
There is no limit to the kinds of monsters you may find in Maga, and certainly all the ones from the BFRPG materials are meant to be compatible. Here is a non-exhaustive list of species particular to the region.

Dolphin Turtle
--------------
Dolphin Turtles have the head and tail of a dolphin, with the shell and fins of a sea turtle. They are large enough to be used as aquatic mounts for a party in addition to carrying a load. Dolphin Turtles can also travel on land, but only for short distances and not as a mount.

Hoverpede
---------
Hoverpedes are giant centipedes that float above the ground using natural magic. They are large enough to be mounted by one person in addition to a load, and multiple could carry a wagon. Note that Hoverpedes to not fly, so falling into a giant abyss is completely possible while mounting a Hoverpede. Hoverpedes cannot travel over water, only solid surfaces.
