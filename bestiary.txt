Bestiary
========
There is no limit to the kinds of monsters you may find in Maga, and certainly all the ones from the BFRPG materials are meant to be compatible. Here is a non-exhaustive list of species particular to the region.

Dolphin Turtle
--------------
Dolphin Turtles have the head and tail of a dolphin, with the shell and fins of a sea turtle. They are large enough to be used as aquatic mounts for a party in addition to carrying a load. Dolphin Turtles can also travel on land, but only for short distances and not as a mount.

**Movement:** 5' Swim 40'

Hoverpede
---------
Hoverpedes are giant centipedes that float above the ground using natural magic. They are large enough to be mounted by one person in addition to a load, and multiple could carry a wagon. Note that Hoverpedes to not fly, so falling into a giant abyss is completely possible while mounting a Hoverpede. Hoverpedes cannot travel over water, only solid surfaces.

**Movement:** 30'

Squiblins
---------
Goblins with squids for heads. Not as hostile as other goblins, but often hired help for villains or Orc allies. They are able to breathe underwater or on dry land indefinitely, but they need to moisturize once every hour before taking damage.
