Oza Province
============
The Oza Province contains three islands: Oza, Raj, and Gui. The province capital is Adroza, located on the southwest coast of Oza. The governor of Oza Province also lives in Adroza. The towns of Oza are Koda, Nura, and Adroza, all located on the coasts of the island. Smaller villages are Isaksted, Hogar, Nuvale, and Shun.

Each island is approximately 600 square miles or so in area. Oza is separated from Raj by about 25 miles of water to the southwest, and again Raj is separated from Gui by about 25 miles of water to the south.

The island of Oza is deforested by about half of its area, with the rest covered in vegetation. To the west there is Cliffwood, which is the much larger forest, and to the east there is Enswood. In the northeast of Oza there is Nurai Cove, which is not used for docking because of the dangerous creatures that inhabit the cove.

The Town: Koda
--------------

The players will start in the coastal town of Koda, which is on the border between the inhabited parts of Oza and the undeveloped area of Cliffwood. Most of the dungeons the players will find are in Cliffwood.

Koda is a fairly large town, with a population of 2100 people. There are about 150 guards, who keep the town safe from monsters that lurk in Cliffwood. Important landmarks are:

- Pretty Good Armor: a smithy
- An open market where groceries and jewelry are sold
- Jaconis's General Goods: a pawn shop
- The Weary Huntsman: a fletcher
- The Cow & Chicken Tavern: a higher-end tavern
- The Black Rat: a lower-end pub, and meeting place of the Thieves Guild
- A Mages Guild hall
- A Mercenaries Guild hall
- A Bards Guild hall
- The mayor's office
- The docks, where a free ferry to Adroza or Nura can be taken. Players can also go to the other islands for the cost of 1 GP per head.
- A Chapel of Gora
- Guards Barracks

Threats
-------

### The Kulzari Tribe

The biggest threat looming over Koda right now are Orcs attacks. The Kulzari tribe used to live over the entire island of Oza, but since the colonization they have been pushed further and further into the diminishing Cliffwood in the west and Enswood in the east. Although they have always tried to fight back, for a long time they gave up and allowed the new settlers to stay while still protecting the remaining forest. However, a few years ago, the Kulzari Tribe has changed its ways and has started expanding its territory outside of the forest. They can sometimes be seen at the edges of forest trying to replant trees with the goal of covering the entire island with woods once more. This has lead to several conflicts, some initiated by the Republicans and some initiated by the Orcs. The guards in Koda are on edge as a result.

### Cultists of Vitarum

Another major issue on Oza is demon worship. Vitarum has a fairly large following throughout the entire Oza Province. These cultists believe that deforestation of the islands was a mistake, and work towards reviving the ancient forests. While largely the cultists are Lacertines, members of all the races are found in her sanctuaries. These cultists are willing to use violence to spread their message.

Places of Interest
------------------
The Elves never had a strong presence in the Oza region, so there are not many Elven structures although there are one or two. On the other hand, ancient Orcish structures are abundant, some in ruins and some still inhabited by monsters or reclaimed by Orcs of the Kulzari Tribe.
