Oza Province
============
The Oza Province contains three islands: Oza, Raj, and Gui. The province capital is Adroza, located on the southwest coast of Oza. The governor of Oza Province also lives in Adroza. The towns of Oza are Koda, Nura, and Adroza, all located on the coasts of the island. Smaller villages are Isaksted, Hogar, Nuvale, and Shun.

The players will start in the coastal town of Koda, which is on the border between the inhabited parts of Oza and the undeveloped area of Cliffwood. Most of the dungeons the players will find are in Cliffwood.

Koda is a fairly large town, with a population of 2100 people. There are about 150 guards, who keep the town safe from monsters that lurk in Cliffwood. Important landmarks are:

- Pretty Good Armor: a smithy
- An open market where groceries and jewelry are sold
- Jaconis's General Goods: a pawn shop
- The Weary Huntsman: a fletcher
- The Cow & Chicken Tavern: a higher-end tavern
