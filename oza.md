Oza Province
============
The Oza Province contains three islands: Oza, Raj, and Gui. The province capital is Adroza, located on the southwest coast of Oza. The towns of Oza are Koda, Nura, and Adroza, all located on the coasts of the island. Smaller villages are Isaksted, Hogar, Nuvale, and Shun.

The players will start in the coastal town of Koda, which is on the border between the inhabited parts of Oza and the undeveloped area of Cliffwood. Most of the dungeons the players will find are in Cliffwood.

Koda is a fairly large town, with a population of 2100 people. It has a smithy, a grocer, a Mages Guild, a Mercenaries Guild, a Bards Guild, a high-end tavern, a shady pub which is the meeting place of the Thieves Guild, a mayor's office, and a docking district where a free ferry to Adroza or Nura can be taken. Players can also go to the other islands for the cost of 1 GP per head.
