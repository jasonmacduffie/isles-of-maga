Hymn of Maga
============
(This is a popular song, written by an anonymous poet during the revolution)

Awaken thee, Maga, from sleep of death
Great spirit of mourning the tyrant left
Now or never, we must sieze our glory
Not even our cruel enemies can ignore

For each tyrant neck, an axe finds a home
No more will an Elf sit on the Dwarven throne
For freedom is priceless, grimly we attack
We only look onward, we cannot turn back

The Republic will never betray us
It is our honor to die for this cause
All hail the Republic and President
That liberty will reign in our lands
