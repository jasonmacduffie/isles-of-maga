Isles of Maga RPG
=================

Every character has attributes and skills. Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll 4 Fudge dice, and add the result to the most relevant attribute and most relevant skill. If the sum total is equal or greater than the difficulty class of the action, then the action succeeds. Higher rolls above the difficulty class are more impressive successes, and lower rolls below are more damaging failures.

##### Gift options

#### Elf

Elves are intelligent, such that their minimum Reason score is 3.

##### Gift options

- **Magic blood (costs 4):** You have magic coursing through your veins. Add the character's Arcane or Divine skill (whichever is higher) to the daily pool of Spirit Points.

Equipment
---------

### Weapons

One-handed swords, maces, axes, shortbows, and knuckles, all do standard damage without any effect.

Unarmed attacks take an automatic -2 penalty unless wearing knuckles.

Heavy weapons like greatswords give a bonus +1 to attacks, but allow the player to attack only every other turn.

Shortbows have a range of 12 meters and longbows have a range of 24 meters. Longbows get a -1 penalty to all attacks.

Ranged weapons get a -1 penalty for each time the target exceeds the range. For example, a longbow gets a -1 penalty between 22 and 42 meters, a -2 penalty between 43 and 63 meters, etc.

### Armor

Unarmored is the default and has no impact on defense.

- **Leather Armor** gives a +1 bonus to Defense and a -1 penalty to Balance.
- **Mail Armor** gives a +2 bonus to Defense and a -2 penalty to Balance.
- **Plate Armor** gives a +3 bonus to Defense and a -3 penalty to Balance.

Magic
-----
Characters can learn magic spells as their journey progresses. Some spells are arcane, some are divine, and some use the greater of the two. A spell that uses the arcane skill must be learned, but a divine spell is always known because it is cast through faith. There is no minimum level to learn a spell, but its magnitude increases with the relevant spell skill.
