Isles of Maga RPG
=================

Every character has attributes and skills. Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll 4 Fudge dice, and add the result to the most relevant attribute and most relevant skill. If the sum total is equal or greater than the difficulty class of the action, then the action succeeds. Higher rolls above the difficulty class are more impressive successes, and lower rolls below are more damaging failures.

### Race

There are many races in Maga, and your choice of race changes what kinds of gifts you have access to.

#### Human

Humans are the assumed default, so they do not have many special characteristics.

##### Gift options

- **Diplomatic heritage (costs 4):** Your humanity brings you to seek more diplomatic solutions. Once per day, take +4 on a Speech roll instead of rolling the dice.

#### Minikin

Minikins are nimble, such that their minimum Balance score is 3. On the other hand they tend to be frail, such that their maximum Health score is 8.

##### Gift options

- **Minikin luck (costs 4):** Any time you encounter a pile of treasure, you find 20% more wealth than other people.

#### Elf

Elves are intelligent, such that their minimum Reason score is 3.

##### Gift options

- **Magic blood (costs 4):** You have magic coursing through your veins. Add the character's Malevolence or Benevolence skill (whichever is higher) to the daily pool of Spirit Points.

#### Dwarf

Dwarves are resilient, such that their minimum Energy score is 3. On the other hand they tend to be brash, such that their maximum Charm score is 8.

##### Gift options

- **Adrenaline rush (costs 4):** Your warrior nature allows you to shrug off wounds. Once per day, remove a Minor Hurt or lesser injury from your character.

Advancement
-----------

### Gifts

Gifts are qualities of a person that are generally good.

- **Cleric of X (costs 2):** You may take this gift only once. You no longer cast spells out of knowledge, instead casting spells from faith. Select a deity. You may now cast any spell associated with that deity, without needing to learn the spell. On the other hand, you are forbidden from casting spells not associated with that deity.

Equipment
---------

### Weapons

One-handed swords, maces, axes, shortbows, and knuckles, all do standard damage without any effect.

Unarmed attacks take an automatic -2 penalty unless wearing knuckles.

Heavy weapons like greatswords give a bonus +1 to attacks, but allow the player to attack only every other turn.

Shortbows have a range of 12 meters and longbows have a range of 24 meters. Longbows get a -1 penalty to all attacks.

Ranged weapons get a -1 penalty for each time the target exceeds the range. For example, a longbow gets a -1 penalty between 25 and 48 meters, a -2 penalty between 49 and 72 meters, etc.

### Armor

Unarmored is the default and has no impact on defense.

- **Leather Armor** gives a +1 bonus to Defense and a -1 penalty to Balance.
- **Mail Armor** gives a +2 bonus to Defense and a -2 penalty to Balance.
- **Plate Armor** gives a +3 bonus to Defense and a -3 penalty to Balance.

Combat
------
In combat, characters have a number of Action Points equal to their Balance. The character with the highest Balance moves first, and the least Balance moves last. Every turn, a player describes the actions that their character takes over the next 4 seconds, where 1 action generally takes 1 second. Therefore a character with a Balance of 4 can take 4 actions per turn, a character with a Balance of 1 can take 1 action per turn, and a character with a Balance of 10 can take 10 actions per turn. However, for each of these characters the turn lasts for 4 seconds.

Melee combat attacks use Health+Melee vs. Health+Defense. Hand-to-hand attacks use Health+Unarmed vs. Health+Defense, with a -2 penalty to the attacker unless weilding knuckles. Ranged attacks use Awareness+Ranged vs. Balance+Defense.

Magic
-----
Characters can learn magic spells as their journey progresses. Some spells are malevolent and some are benevolent, which will change which skill the spell utilizes.
