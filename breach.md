Isles of Maga RPG
=================

Every character has attributes and skills. Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll 4 Fudge dice, and add the result to the most relevant attribute and most relevant skill. If the sum total is equal or greater than the difficulty class of the action, then the action succeeds. Higher rolls above the difficulty class are more impressive successes, and lower rolls below are more damaging failures.

Equipment

### Weapons

One-handed swords, maces, axes, shortbows, and knuckles, all do standard damage without any effect.

Unarmed attacks take an automatic -2 penalty unless wearing knuckles.

### Armor

Unarmored is the default and has no impact on defense.

- **Mail Armor** gives a +2 bonus to Defense and a -2 penalty to Balance.
- **Plate Armor** gives a +3 bonus to Defense and a -3 penalty to Balance.

Magic
-----
Characters can learn magic spells as their journey progresses. Some spells are arcane, some are divine, and some use the greater of the two. A spell that uses the arcane skill must be learned, but a divine spell is always known because it is cast through faith. Mana cost is the amount of spirit points that must be spent to cast the spell.

### Banish Demon

Minimum Divine skill: 2

Mana cost: 1

Roll Energy+Divine vs. Energy+Defense against a target demon. If the result is 2 or greater, the demon is sent to its region of Demonia.

### Bound Weapon

Minimum Divine skill: 2

Mana cost: 1

One weapon may be bound to the caster's soul at a time, costing 1 spirit point to perform the binding. The caster should have spent some time using the bound weapon to form a bond with it. At any time, the caster can summon the bound weapon and immediately equip it coasting 1 spirit point. The weapon binding may be dismissed at any time without cost.

### Ghost Blade

Minimum Arcane skill: 2

The caster creates a Duration: 1 round/level

The caster equips a blade of magic from their hand. This weapon may be of various sizes, taking on the properties of the equivalent physical blade.

The weapon itself has no weight. If the caster lets go of the weapon, it disappears. The weapon can also be destroyed by Dispel Magic. At the end of the duration, the weapon vanishes. The weapon is magical, and can do damage to ghosts.

### Soul Trap

Minimum Arcane skill: 3

This spell will not work on an intelligent, sentient being. When the target dies, roll Reason+Arcane vs. the target's static Energy score. If the result is at least 4, the target's soul may be captured in a gem large enough to contain it.
