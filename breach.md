Isles of Maga RPG
=================

Every character has attributes and skills. Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll 4 Fudge dice, and add the result to the most relevant attribute and most relevant skill. If the sum total is equal or greater than the difficulty class of the action, then the action succeeds. Higher rolls above the difficulty class are more impressive successes, and lower rolls below are more damaging failures.
