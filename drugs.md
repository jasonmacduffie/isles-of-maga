Drugs
=====
With the notable exception of alcohol, tobacco, and caffiene, most psychoactive drugs are illegal in the Republic. This is a severe change from the Kingdoms, where drugs were generally legal though still had some social stigma associated with them.

Alcohol
-------
There are no restrictions on alcohol.

Tobacco
-------
There are no restrictions on tobacco.

Caffiene (Coffee & Tea)
-----------------------
There are no restrictions on caffiene.

Cannabis
--------
Cannabis is the most frequently used illegal drug with the largest market. Although technically illegal, the Republic does not spend a large amount of resources rooting out cannabis use.

The smoking of cannabis is a tradition among necromancers, which is the main reason behind its illegality.

Opium
-----
Opuim is illegal.
