Drugs
=====
With the notable exception of alcohol, tobacco, and caffiene, most psychoactive drugs are illegal in the Republic. This is a severe change from the Kingdoms, where drugs were generally legal though still had some social stigma associated with them. However, while technically illegal under the Republic, the authorities generally do not go after private use and only blatant public use is considered actionable.

Alcohol
-------
There are no legal restrictions on the production and consumption of alcohol. Clerics of Gora are forbidden from drinking alcohol.

Tobacco
-------
There are no legal restrictions on the production and consumption of tobacco. Clerics of Gora are forbidden from consuming tobacco.

Caffiene (Coffee & Tea)
-----------------------
There are no legal restrictions on the production and consumption of coffee, tea, and other sources of caffiene. Clerics of Gora are forbidden from consuming coffee or tea.

Cannabis
--------
Cannabis is the most frequently used illegal drug with the largest market. Although technically illegal, the Republic does not spend a large amount of resources rooting out cannabis use.

The smoking of cannabis is a tradition among necromancers, which is the main reason behind its illegality.

Opium
-----
Opuim is a less-frequently used illegal drug.
