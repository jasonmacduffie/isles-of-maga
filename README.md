The Isles of Maga
=================
![Region Map](region-map.png)

Isles of Maga is a role playing setting that I am creating, in particular for use with the Basic Fantasy RPG (BFRPG). However it is general enough to be used by any other system.

The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, and you are expected to make alterations in your campaign to suit yourself. Here is the basic information for how things work in the year 2E308 (the 308th year of the Modern Republic).

Although the greatest information is given about the Magathos region, it is expected that you will create adventures in remote locations with more or less contact with the capital district. The idea behind this is to give players and GMs a frame of reference without binding them to the history of any one particular region. There should be no complete listing of all the regions in Maga; all lists are incomplete. While the entirety of Maga is claimed by the Republic, certain regions are technically outside of its rule. This gives plenty of room for a variety of complex political situations, and the scale of area and elevation gives some flexibility in climate.

Language
--------
The languages are the same as per the BFRPG rules, there are some changes in the significance however. "Common" is actually a modern dialect of the Dwarvish language, and "Dwarvish" refers to an ancient, no longer used dialect.

Dwarvish, Halfling, Elvish, and Common all use the Dwarvish alphabet.

These are the additional racial languages:
- Lacertinean, the language of Lacertines and Troglodytes (Dwarvish alphabet for Lacertines, Orcish alphabet for Troglodytes)
- Felidinean, the language of Felidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Corvidinean, the language of Corvidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Vespertinean, the language of Vespertines (Dwarvish alphabet)

Orc-aligned racial languages:
- Orcish, the language of Orcs, but which is commonly used by other Orc-aligned races (Orcish alphabet)
- Gnollish, the language of Gnolls (Orcish alphabet)
- Goblinish, the language of Goblins (Orcish alphabet)
- Koboldish, the language of Kobolds (Orcish alphabet)
- Ogrish, the language of Ogres (Orcish alphabet)
- Trollish, the language of Trolls (Orcish alphabet)

More exotic languages:
- Demonic, the language of Demons (Demonic alphabet)
- Dragonish, the language of Dragons (Dragonish alphabet)
- Giantish, the language of Giants (Giantish alphabet)
- Sylvish, the language of Dryads and Treants (Demonic alphabet)

Factions
--------
Although Maga is united under the banner of the Republic, the reach of the government is not universal and there is discord across the isles. Here are some of the factions you may interact with:

### Republicans
![Republic Flag](republic_flag.png)

Republican is a general term for those politically aligned with the Modern Republic. This includes loyal citizens of the Republic, public officials, and organizations employed by the Republic.

#### The Order of Skulls

The Order of Skulls is not officially recognized as being part of the Republic, and some attempt is made to keep its existence secret. Nonetheless, rumors of its existence are abundant, and evidence of its actions stand. The Order of Skulls is the covert branch of the Republican government, acting for the office of the President in ensuring that the Republic continues to stand strong, sometimes using technically illegal methods.

#### The Moonguard

The Moonguard, unlike the Order of Skulls, is an officially recognized organization within the Republic. The Moonguard have the responsibility to ensure order is kept under the Republic, and have chapters spread throughout the regions. Unlike the Order of Skulls, public scrutiny means they cannot resort to illegal action.

### Monarchists

A significant number of Elves, and some Humans, still advocate the return of the Elven Kingdoms. These people are known as monarchists. While advocating monarchism is not illegal, it is cause for suspicion, and even minor rouses to action can be a basis for arrest. Many monarchists go further, plotting the overthrow of the Republic. Although they are not representative of the general public feeling, there are enough monarchists to present a real threat if they become organized.

### The Order of Ancients

The Order of Ancients is a secretive organization that is not aligned with the Republic, Monarchists, or the Orcish Tribes. Rather, they adapt to each political circumstance, and attempt to influence policy to benefit their own ends. It is unknown whether the Order of Ancients really exists, or is just a rumor.

### Orcish Tribes

To this day, Orcish Tribes and their allies continue to take up arms against the Republic and refuse integration with it out of principle.

### Guilds

There are a number of trade associations, called guilds, in Maga. They are not aligned with each other but are kept here for organizational purposes.

#### Mercenaries Guild

The Mercenaries Guild is an organization sanctioned by the Republic to take contracts that require violence to resolve.

#### Mages Guild

The Mages Guild is responsible for researching and dispensing magical knowledge. In particular, the Mages Guild makes a strong attempt to prevent magic from being accessible to the general public because of its immense power. Most Magic-Users should start out as members of the Mages Guild, otherwise their practice of arcane magic is illegal.

#### Thieves Guild

The Thieves Guild is a highly organized crime syndicate with branches all throughout Maga.

#### Bards Guild

The Bards Guild is an association of bards, or epic poem writers.

### Church of Gora

The Church of Gora is the collective name for the adherents and clergy of the worship of Gora, the only officially recognized religion in Maga. Gora worshippers will sometimes go on missions to convert members of beast-races throughout Maga, who often times worship Demon Lords.

#### The Silver Sword

The Silver Sword is an organization dedicated to hunting demon worshippers, necromancy, vampires, werewolves, and other creatures they deem unholy.

### Demonic Cults

Every Demon Lord has his or her own group of worshippers. In particular, the patron/matron deities of the beast-races have large numbers of followers. Not all cults are inherently malicious, but some are, and all must practice in secret due to the illegal status of their religion.

### Vampire Clans

Vampires will sometimes form clans.

### Bandit/Pirate Groups and Crime Syndicates

Aside from the Thieves Guild, there are a number of bandit and pirates that group together, as well as organized crime syndicates. They are not named here, but they are not uncommon in the less ruly parts of Maga.
