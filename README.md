The Isles of Maga
=================
![Region Map](region-map.png)

Isles of Maga is a role playing setting that I am creating, in particular for use with the Basic Fantasy RPG (BFRPG). However it is general enough to be used by any other system.

The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, and you are expected to make alterations in your campaign to suit yourself. Here is the basic information for how things work in the year 2E308 (the 308th year of the Modern Republic).

Although the greatest information is given about the Magathos region, it is expected that you will create adventures in remote locations with more or less contact with the capital district. The idea behind this is to give players and GMs a frame of reference without binding them to the history of any one particular region. There should be no complete listing of all the regions in Maga; all lists are incomplete. While the entirety of Maga is claimed by the Republic, certain regions are technically outside of its rule. This gives plenty of room for a variety of complex political situations, and the scale of area and elevation gives some flexibility in climate.

History
-------
Although it has been touched upon, here is an organized account of the history of Maga.

### Before 1E

#### Before Colonization

Before the arrival of Dwarves, Elves, Humans, and Halflings, there is strong evidence that Maga was under the rule of a powerful Orcish civilization. However, the Orcs did not keep a history of their civilization, so very little is known about it. The arrival of the human-like races did not disrupt their civilization; it had collapsed into the tribal society prior to that. The reasons for this are unknown. Orcs are still organized in this manner into the second era.

During this time, the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) also populated the region. They likely were also ruled by the Orcish civilization.

#### The Age of Exploration

The first Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings reach the shores of Maga. In the beginning their numbers were few, but as they explored more and more of Maga they became more prevalant. Eventually the majority of Maga became populated with these human-like races. There were not many conflicts within the human-like races, instead the focus being on clearing out the area of the hostile locals, including the beast races.

In particular, the Orcs were resistant to what they perceived as invaders. Up to the second era, the various Orcish tribes continue to put up a fight, although their numbers have diminished significantly. It is this continued hostility that has prevented from them being integrated with any of the upcoming civilizations, unlike the beast-races.

#### The Age of Industry

Following was a time of peace, after the Orcish residents and other hostile races were mostly cleared out, and before the beginning of the formation of states that would develop soon. What were formerly small villages began to grow and eventually become cities. Dwarves continued to build underground, and the other races continued forming new villages and cities on the various islands. This time also marked the beginning of interaction with beast-races, and when people began to learn about the local worship of Demon Lords and share their religion.

Trade flourished during this time, and industries were becoming better established to fight off hostile races, sail the rougher parts of the waters, clearing out of the jungle terrain, and the development under Magathos by the Dwarves.

#### The Age of Statecraft

As industry continued, separate races formed their own states. The greatest state belonged to the kingdom of the Dwarves, which held the seat of Thronerock which is still the location of the capital of the Modern Republic during the second era. Elves, Humans, and Halflings had smaller city states, but many were strong enough to compare to the unified Dwarven kingdom during the early days.

The Elves had worshipped Gora for many ages before, but for the first time worship of Gora was organized into churches as an organized religion. They viewed the demon worship of the natives as well as the other human-like races as disgusting and evil given the misanthropic tendencies of some Demon Lords. However, they were not in a position to do anything about it, and traded with these races anyway.

The Dwarves were proud of their strength as a country, and limited their interaction with the other races during this time. They would continue carving out huge castles under Magathos. The other races, on the other hand, had more or less amicable relations with each other and traded with one another.

The Elves saw an increase of power through non-military means, by enveloping Human and Halfling city states with the promise of greater protection from hostile races like the Orcs, and access to important islands for trade. The city states retained their autonomy in terms of laws, but would swear fealty towards these Elven kings and paid a small tax to them.

Before the first era began, the various Elven kings controlled most of Maga, except for around the Magathos region. Seeing that the Dwarves were weakened, and the economic importance of Magathos, the Elves launched a full scale invasion. The Dwarves were completely unprepared for this. They fought valiantly, but in the end the Elves controlled Magathos and the surrounding area, and the Magathos region established its own kingdom ruled by an Elf monarch.

### 1E: The Elven Kingdoms

The beginning of the first era saw the first unification of the races under one banner: the banner of the Elves. This unification marks the first era. There was not a centralized government, but a number of allied kingdoms, each with an Elf as monarch. Elvish was the Common language, although this was not strictly enforced and many regions had the majority race's language as a co-official language. Each race was still free to use its own alphabet for their language.

This era also saw the greatest attempt to completely stamp out demon worship. By the end of the first era, worship of Demon Lords among Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings was nearly completely obliterated, and all worshipped the more abstract deity Gora. Less effort was put into stamping out worship among the beast-races due to the fact that they were not integrated as citizens, although some minor missions were carried out.

Although in the beginning the Elven kings and queens were careful to be even-handed, the descendants who would inherit their thrones became increasingly unconcerned with the needs of their subjects. Many of the monarchs during the end of the period were incredibly harsh, even to Humans who held the highest positions in society besides Elves. Halfling farmers and Dwarf miners were taxed more and more onerously.

### 2E: The Modern Republic

The revolution that ended the first era gave rise to the Modern Republic. A contemporary, standardized form of Dwarvish became the Common language instead of Elvish; the human-like and beast races were also required to use the Dwarvish alphabet when writing in their own languages, even though not all sounds could be properly pronounced with it. This has been the source of some minor friction with the Republic.

The Republic is a federated state divided into a large number of autonomous districts, each of which manages its own subregions in a similar fashion. However, the districts have less control over their population than the Kingdoms did, and some areas have become retaken by Orcs and other native creatures. Some areas are fairly isolated, and are part of the Republic in name only.

The Republic continued the goal of the Elves to stamp out demon worship. However, their task was not as great due to the work already accomplished. The main area of focus was the beast-races and their patron/matron Demon Lords, now that they were considered full citizens of the Republic.

Technology
----------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of cannons and guns. There are also magical constructs, which are mindless machines that were animated by magic.

Religion
--------
The "good" religion in Maga is monotheistic, worshipping the deity called Gora. However, Gora does not actively perform miracles, and the power of Clerics, like Magic-Users, comes from their life energy rather than a blessing from Gora. In fact, there is no physical evidence that Gora exists, but rather his existence is based on an oral tradition dating thousands of years that eventually became a written tradition and organized into churches.

However, there are a large number of "evil" religions in Maga, each serving a Demon Lord. Unlike Gora, the existence of Demon Lords is undeniable and apparent. Although the worship of the Demon Lords is forbidden culturally and legally, they all have their own share of worshippers. Demon Lords are considered evil compared to Gora, and while they generally tend to be misanthropic, some actually follow a more complex grey morality. Furthermore, all the beast races traditionally worship a patron or matron Demon Lord rather than Gora (although some do worship Gora), and have a much more positive perception of the Demon Lord they follow. Some trades also have their share of followers with a similar view as the beast races: there are merchants who worship Opulentum, and sailors who worship Nautarum, for example.

A Cleric, then, is permitted to serve a Demon Lord as a patron/matron deity, but they cannot do so openly. As stated earlier, the power of Clerics does not come from a blessing, but from their life-energy.

Demon Lords all have their own region in the land of Demonia. Demonia is located deep underground, far deeper than any mortal could possibly go. The different regions are called Baronies of Demonia. Each Lord also has their own kind of demons that fit their nature.

These are some of the major Demon Lords (feel free to make new ones):

- **Pastorum**, Patron of Ghosts (worshipped by Corvidines). His demons are called Nonces, which are the ghosts of deceased sentient races. Upon death, a Nonce retains the memories of its life, but loses its sense of identity. His Barony is called Arcadia, a land of rolling hills and meadows that are perpetually lit by moonlight. His appearance is of a human skeleton in a robe, with the skull of a bull. In one hand he holds a shepherd's crook, and in the other hand he holds a box lantern.
- **Umbrarum**, Matron of Shadows (worshipped by Vespertines). Her demons are, likewise, called Shadows, which are incorporeal manifestations of darkness. Her Barony is called The Silent Vale, and is a large grassland where it is always night, lacking even a moon and only lit by the stars. Her appearance is that of a woman with pitch black skin, wearing a garment that is equally dark and featureless. She has on her belt a dagger, and holds a longbow with a quiver of arrows on her back.
- **Solum**, Matron of Light (worshipped by Felidines). Her demons are called Zegnas, which appear as human beings with featureless, alabaster white skin, and the wings of doves. Solum's Barony is called The Sunpeaks, which are a white rocky terrain where there is always sunlight. Her appearance is simply that of a giant Zegna, dressed in a suit of steel armor and a white cape, holding a longsword in her right hand and a round shield in her left hand.
- **Vitarum**, Matron of the Woods (worshipped by Lacertines). Her demons are called Ursoths, which appear like ordinary, slightly larger than normal bears. However, Ursoths are intelligent and can speak. Vitarum's Barony is called the Twilight Pines, a tremendous pine forest with trees so high the sun is always eclipsed. Her Barony is home to a large number of animals we would recognize, and also many we would not. Her appearance is that of a woman wearing the attire of a priestess. She holds a tall staff that looks like a living tree branch with leaves still attached. On her belt is an apothecary satchel.
- **Primarium**, Patron of Disaster. His demons are called Elementals, which are intelligent beings made of fire, water, air, or earth. His Barony is called Tormentia, a region where the land never sits still. There are constant earthquakes and landslides, incredible gusts and lightning, and tremendous fires and tsunamis. His appearance is as chaotic as his domain: he is a mixture of flames, water, wind, and rock. He does not hold a constant shape, but typically presents himself as humanoid.
- **Morborum**, Patron of Plague
- **Opulentum**, Patron of Deals
- **Nautarum**, Matron of the Seas
- **Terror**, Patron of Fear. His demons are called Angstworms, which are worm-like creatures as large as an alligator and with reptilian hide. Angstworms have no head, face, or eyes, although they do have a mouth with sharp teeth. Terror's Barony is called The Void Realms, and is made of large rocks floating in space. The Angstworms are able to fly and move around freely in this medium. It is possible for a human to fall off one of the rocks and into an abyss. Terror's appearance is that of a deformed man, with tentacles coming from random parts of his body, and one eye completely overtaken by a large tumor. Slime pours from his mouth. To some extent he is a shapeshifter, but all of his forms are equally horrible.
- **Nefastum**, Matron of Thuggery
- **Ultimatum**, Patron of the End Times

Metaphysics
-----------
There is only one world: the physical world that we occupy in Maga. As stated earlier, Demonia is not in another plane of existence. Rather, it is deep underground. Portals to Demonia physically teleport what passes through it, the same as other teleportation magic. Magic is also physical: it comes from a creature's life energy, for Magic-Users through their knowledge and for Clerics through their faith.

Races/Species
-------------
Aside from the four human-like races (Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans), there are four beast races: Lacertines (lizard people), Felidines (cat people), Corvidines (crow people), and Vespertines (bat people). Because the four non-beast races already have details in the BFRPG rules, they are mainly described in terms of their political relationships. The beast races have full descriptions for player characters.

It is up to the GM whether to include Lizard Men in the setting or to substitute them for Lacertines. To leave this ambiguous, no references to Lizard Men outside of Lacertines are made in these documents.

The beast races are all given some traditional names to choose from. However, many choose or are given Common or Dwarven names, depending on where they are from. Some also choose descriptive titles as a substitute for their names, such as Swift-runner (for a particularly fast individual).

### Dwarves

Politically, Dwarves are the most powerful race in Maga, having initiated the revolution that overthrew the Elven Kingdoms and established the Modern Republic, and now occupy more than 50% of the Electorate. Their rule is heavy-handed, but not outrageously so to most citizens of Maga who know of the horror stories from the Elven Kingdoms. Due to their political status, Dwarves have somewhat of a privileged position in society, which some other races are wary of.

### Elves

While the Dwarves are celebrated in Maga, the Elves are shunned. Once ruling several glorious kingdoms during the First Era, known as the Elven Kingdoms, since the revolution they have been completely disgraced. The Elven Kingdoms were famous for their cruelty towards non-Elves, and their numerous violent purges of Demon Lord worship. Although few Elves today were even alive during that time, the actions of the past still haunt them. Only the few descendants of those Elves who rebelled are in the Electorate, making less than 1%. Most Elves simply want to move on with life, but others long for the day of their return to rule.

Elves have a much shorter lifespan in Maga than in the BFRPG rules: 300 to 400 years is typical.

### Halflings

Along with Humans, the Halflings occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves. They assisted with the overthrow of the Elven Kingdoms, but did not play a central role. Halflings occupy around 15% of the Electorate, and have their own political interests. The Halflings have mainly contributed economically in the role of farmers, although there are a few Halfling traders as well.

### Humans

Humans occupy a rung on the power structure between Dwarves and Elves, but not in the same way as Halflings. While the Halflings are notable for being generally benign during the revolution, Humans are notable for taking the extremes on both sides: some of the greatest heroes of the revolution, and greatest villains loyal to the Kingdoms, were Human. As a result, Humans manage to occupy around 25% of the Electorate. Their role in society is complicated by the fact that Humans held a relatively high regard in the Elven Kingdoms, being seen as greater than the other non-Elf races, although nowhere near the position of Elves. Some Humans think that life was better for them before the Republic, and seek to restore the Kingdoms back to their former glory.

### Lacertines

**Description:** The Lacertines are semi-aquatic humanoids descended from lizards. They have a reputation for being thoughtful and independent, but also lazy and selfish. Their unique ancestry allows them to hold their breath comfortably for around 30 minutes if necessary. They are not as naturally social as the other races, and generally keep to small tribes at the largest. While some have adapted to civilization, it is a struggle for their nature.

**Restrictions:** Lacertines are required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9, and a maximum Charisma of 17 due to their solitary tendencies.

**Special Abilities:** Lacertines are able to hold their breath for 30 minutes at a time comfortably. They can continue for another 5 minutes with discomfort, after which they will take damage like an ordinary Human. Because of their natural claws, unarmed melee attacks deal 1d4 damage, and may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Lacertines save at +5 at Death Ray or Poison, +4 at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

#### Typical names

Lacertinean is composed of fewer sounds than Commons. Here is approximately their alphabet:

D,L,N,S,T,TH,Z

There is only a single generic vowel in Lacertinean, sometimes denoted by "E" when necessary but also left out sometimes. Here are examples of Lacertine names with the vowel:

- Lenedeth
- Zesteth
- Thedent
- Tenthez
- Sezeth
- Nesteth

### Felidines

**Description:** The Felidines are humanoids descended from large cats. They have a reputation for being stealthy and curious, but also aloof and cowardly. They are especially nimble and cunning, and make excellent thieves or scouts. Like the other beast races, they hold a lesser position in Maga society.

**Restrictions:** Felidines are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9, and a maximum Wisdom of 17 due to their natural impulsiveness.

**Special Abilities:** Felidines have Darkvision within a 60' range. Furthermore, their stealth allows them to have only a 10% chance of being detected when in the forest, or a 30% chance in other terrain. Their natural claws give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Felidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

#### Typical names

Felidines use a wide variety of vocalizations that cannot be accessed by other races. This means there is a severe transformation in traditional names to something pronounceable by other races. The vocalizations are:

- Purr (denoted by r)
- Meow (denoted by m, followed by a vowel)
- Hiss (denoted by s)
- Huff (denoted by h)
- Chirp (denoted by ch, followed by a vowel)

Here are examples of names:

- Rumiaschi
- Chasisi
- Harascha
- Sachara
- Miascha
- Mirmia

### Corvidines

**Description:** Corvidines are humanoids descended from crows, but have lost the ability to fly due to their size. They have a reputation for being wise and crafty, but also grim and mysterious. Their association with death is compounded by their relationship to their patron deity, Pastorum. They are relatively frail due to their weaker bones from their bird ancestry.

**Restrictions:** Corvidines are required to have a minimum Wisdom of 9, and a maximum Constitution of 17 due to their natural fragility. Corvidines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class.

**Special Abilities:** Corvidines have an uncanny knowledge of secrecy, and can find hidden doors on 1-2 on 1d6 rather than 1. They also have a 1 on 1d6 chance of discovering a secret door on a cursory look. Their natural talons give unarmed melee attacks 1d4 damage, which may be lethal.

**Saving Throws:** Corvidines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

#### Typical names

Corvidines are the most difficult names to translate, because their language is largely communicated through bird songs with few consonants. However, over the ages they have developed names that continue a cultural distinction while being available to other races to pronounce. Here are some typical names:

- Korooko
- Frookoo
- Kawrook
- Badoot
- Zooka
- Daboota

### Vespertines

![vespertine.png](vespertine.png)

**Description:** Vespertines are a small humanoid beast race descended from bats that lost their ability to fly due to their size. They tend to be between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh between 60 and 90 pounds. Their fur is usually brown, grey, or black, though white fur is not unheard of. They always have black beady eyes. Vespertines live in large tribal communities, and usually make their homes in caves in the middle of rainforests. Vespertine communities are sometimes hostile, but always in self-defense and not aggressively.

Vespertines have an omnivorous diet of insects and fruit. Vespertines tend to dress plainly, in cloth or leather. Vespertines reach adulthood at 10 years, and have a lifespan of between 30 and 40 years.

Vespertines speak their own language, Vespertinean, and most know Common. Vespertines do not tend toward any particular class, and generally prefer to use diplomacy before entering combat. They are varied in their skills, having capable fighters, clerics, magic-users, and thieves among them. Vespertines have a reputation for being cheerful and sociable, but also sometimes disloyal and scheming.

**Restrictions:** Vespertines are required to have a minimum Charisma of 9, and a maximum Strength of 17 due to their small stature. Vespertines never roll larger than a d6 for hit points, regardless of class. Vespertines may not use Large weapons, and must hold Medium weapons with both hands.

**Special Abilities:** Vespertines can use sonar to "see" in total darkness, which mechanically works like 60' of Darkvision. Also, Vespertines have the ability to create a shrill noise in a line for a 100' range, dealing 1d4 points of damage to any creatures on that line.

**Saving Throws:** Vespertines save at +4 at Death Ray or Poison, at Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and +3 at Dragon Breath.

#### Typical names

Vespertinean is composed of chirp-like vocalizations. Their alphabet is difficult to reproduce in our language, but approximately their language has these sounds:

A,B,BL,CH,D,I,K,PR,SP,T,TW

Vowels are often times elongated, noted by three repeating vowels. Other races can ignore the elongation and still be understood.

Examples of names could be:

- Adikprit
- Twiblitriii
- Blidkit
- Priblid
- Chitwiiik
- Kiblaaachi

### Orc-aligned Races

These races are hostile to both the beast-races and the human-like races in Maga. The Orcs are not organized like the Republic, but rather have a decentralized system of tribes. In the past these tribes tended to war with each other, but as of late they have been united in spirit and aggression is directed toward the Republic that claims ownership of their lands. However, there is still not a central administration. The other races that are aligned with Orcs also precede the colonization of Maga, and share similar stake in the conflict.

#### Orcs

Unlike many other settings, Orcs are not inherently bent on domination as a species. As a culture, however, a great deal of their social customs have developed from a spirit of war and conquest. Historically, the various Orc tribes would fight against each other. Today, they use their warrior spirit to battle against the Republic that claims their lands.

It would also be incorrect to paint Orcs are merely misunderstood. They are perhaps the most aggressive of the intelligent races, and most likely to reject surrender, retreat, or diplomacy. Their history is painted with war, and they are known to have subjugated all of the other Orc-aligned races in a powerful civilization before the colonization began.

Also, Orcs are more likely to form relationships with humans than in other settings. Although it is still unlikely given the political turmoil involved, there have been a number of Half-Orcs born under loving relationships. However, these children are destined to be completely unintegrated both in Republican society, as well as Orcish society, and potentially attacked by either one.

#### Gnolls

Gnolls are fairly intelligent, and may be users of sword, bow, or magic depending on its individual talent. They tend to live in loosely knit tribes, similarly to Ogres but with much more organization and intelligence. Gnolls are not as integrated with Orcish society as Goblins, but some are fairly close. They tend to form separate tribes but will occasionally join Orcs in battle against the Republic.

#### Goblins

Goblins are about as intelligent as Orcs, and have a very close history with them. They are the most likely of Orc-aligned races to join them in arms, and the most integrated in Orcish society. However, they still represent a lower social caste than Orcs. Advanced Goblins, such as Hobgoblins, are of particular intelligence and skill, and make for warriors that are a match for Orcs. Although Goblins have their own culture and tradition separate from Orcs, the influence of Orcish society has been overwhelming and to some degree Goblin society has influenced Orcish culture.

#### Kobolds

Kobolds are not inherently aggressive, but will attack any races they do not trust out of concern for their own safety. They are far more intelligent and cunning than most other Orc-aligned races. They have a highly cohesive tribal structure which is outside of Orcish society, but also sometimes overlaps in areas where Kobolds have integrated. Kobolds are excellent ranged fighters and trappers.

#### Ogres

Ogres form small clans, but are far less social and civilized than the Orcs. They tend to live in the woods, caves, or vacant ruins rather than to construct their own buildings. They are aggressive in a territorial way, but do not actively engage in battle with the Republic unless sided with an Orc tribe. They are not intelligent enough to understand the complex politics involved, and just tend to side with Orcs because of their historical connection under the Orcish empire.

#### Trolls

Trolls do not have a warring culture like the Orcs, nor do they have a territorial nature like the Ogres. Instead, they tend to hunt the human-like races for the fun of the hunt. They are more animalistic than the other Orc-aligned races, but still have the ability to communicate in their own language and Orcish. Again, like the other races, their tendency to occasionally side with Orcs comes with the historical connection under the Orcish empire, and thus some are integrated well with Orcish society as warriors.

Classes
-------
There are no race/class restrictions whatsoever, at least from a lore perspective. Fighter/Magic-Users are common in Maga among Dwarves and Humans, and Magic-Users are common among Halflings, for example. The GM is free to restrict players in this manner, but there is no inherent reason why any race cannot become any class.

Magic
-----
Magic (both divine and arcane) comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, arcane magic is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very controlled by the Mages Guild. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life unless there is a local Mages Guild. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power. In fact, it is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast arcane spells.

Divine magic is not regulated at all, unlike arcane magic, and your local neighborhood priest probably knows a healing spell or two. The Mages Guild holds no responsibility for the magic of Clerics.

Because magic is not "prepared" as in the default BFRPG rules, there are alternative rules the GM may use for Magic-Users and Clerics. The rules are simple: a Magic-User learns spells in the ordinary way at the same rate, and a Cleric has access to all spells available at the ordinary rate. However, instead of preparation, a spellcaster can cast any available spell at will. Doing so will consume an amount of "spell points" equal to the spell level. For example, a Level 2 spell will cost 2 spell points.

Spell points return to the maximum amount overnight. A character's spell points is equal to the character level, plus an ability bonus. In the case of Magic-Users, the bonus is their Intelligence. In the case of Clerics, the bonus is their Wisdom. For example, a level 3 Magic-User with an Intelligence bonus of +1 will have a maximum spell points of 4.

Raise Dead and Reincarnate still work as per the BFRPG rules, however doing so may raise the anger of Pastorum, who expected a new ghost to serve him. Therefore, bringing people back to life is uncommon and taboo in Maga, but still possible if they died recently and not of old age.

Animate Dead for use as mindless minions such as zombies or skeletons is considered necromancy in Maga, which is outlawed. Note that Magic-Users and Clerics are still *able* to do so, but not in the open.

Some spells are tweaked to make more sense in the setting:

- **Detect Evil** becomes **Detect Demonic**: The spell is only useful for detecting the presence of demons and demonic powers; it has nothing to do with evil intentions. The reverse is **Detect Anti-Demonic**. The exact same principle applies to **Protection from Evil** becoming **Protection from Demonic** (reverse **Protection from Anti-Demonic**), and **Dispel Evil** becoming **Dispel Demonic**. Note that undead creatures in particular are not considered demonic (though they are magical), with the exception of Nonces which are undead, magical, and demonic. Anti-Demonic objects are ones that are imbued with the power to cause great harm to demons.

- **Commune** does not contact a patron deity; instead it contacts a particular Demon Lord, or at least a servant demon if the Lord is not available. The Demon Lord does not need to be the patron of that cleric. The Demon Lord must be willing to talk to the Cleric for the spell to work, however.

- **Conjure Elemental** summons one of Primarium's demons to fight for you. Elementals are all Primarium's servants, but when you summon one it is under your control.

Language
--------
The languages are the same as per the BFRPG rules, there are some changes in the significance however. "Common" is actually a modern dialect of the Dwarvish language, and "Dwarvish" refers to an ancient, no longer used dialect.

Dwarvish, Halfling, Elvish, and Common all use the Dwarvish alphabet.

These are the additional racial languages:
- Lacertinean, the language of Lacertines and Troglodytes (Dwarvish alphabet for Lacertines, Orcish alphabet for Troglodytes)
- Felidinean, the language of Felidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Corvidinean, the language of Corvidines (Dwarvish alphabet)
- Vespertinean, the language of Vespertines (Dwarvish alphabet)

Orc-aligned racial languages:
- Orcish, the language of Orcs, but which is commonly used by other Orc-aligned races (Orcish alphabet)
- Gnollish, the language of Gnolls (Orcish alphabet)
- Goblinish, the language of Goblins (Orcish alphabet)
- Koboldish, the language of Kobolds (Orcish alphabet)
- Ogrish, the language of Ogres (Orcish alphabet)
- Trollish, the language of Trolls (Orcish alphabet)

More exotic languages:
- Demonic, the language of Demons (Demonic alphabet)
- Dragonish, the language of Dragons (Dragonish alphabet)
- Giantish, the language of Giants (Giantish alphabet)
- Sylvish, the language of Dryads and Treants (Demonic alphabet)

Factions
--------
Although Maga is united under the banner of the Republic, the reach of the government is not universal and there is discord across the isles. Here are some of the factions you may interact with:

### Republicans
![Republic Flag](republic_flag.png)

Republican is a general term for those politically aligned with the Modern Republic. This includes loyal citizens of the Republic, public officials, and organizations employed by the Republic.

#### The Order of Skulls

The Order of Skulls is not officially recognized as being part of the Republic, and some attempt is made to keep its existence secret. Nonetheless, rumors of its existence are abundant, and evidence of its actions stand. The Order of Skulls is the covert branch of the Republican government, acting for the office of the President in ensuring that the Republic continues to stand strong, sometimes using technically illegal methods.

#### The Moonguard

The Moonguard, unlike the Order of Skulls, is an officially recognized organization within the Republic. The Moonguard have the responsibility to ensure order is kept under the Republic, and have chapters spread throughout the regions. Unlike the Order of Skulls, public scrutiny means they cannot resort to illegal action.

### Monarchists

A significant number of Elves, and some Humans, still advocate the return of the Elven Kingdoms. These people are known as monarchists. While advocating monarchism is not illegal, it is cause for suspicion, and even minor rouses to action can be a basis for arrest. Many monarchists go further, plotting the overthrow of the Republic. Although they are not representative of the general public feeling, there are enough monarchists to present a real threat if they become organized.

### The Order of Ancients

The Order of Ancients is a secretive organization that is not aligned with the Republic, Monarchists, or the Orcish Tribes. Rather, they adapt to each political circumstance, and attempt to influence policy to benefit their own ends. It is unknown whether the Order of Ancients really exists, or is just a rumor.

### Orcish Tribes

To this day, Orcish Tribes and their allies continue to take up arms against the Republic and refuse integration with it out of principle.

### Guilds

There are a number of trade associations, called guilds, in Maga. They are not aligned with each other but are kept here for organizational purposes.

#### Mercenaries Guild

The Mercenaries Guild is an organization sanctioned by the Republic to take contracts that require violence to resolve.

#### Mages Guild

The Mages Guild is responsible for researching and dispensing magical knowledge. In particular, the Mages Guild makes a strong attempt to prevent magic from being accessible to the general public because of its immense power. Most Magic-Users should start out as members of the Mages Guild, otherwise their practice of arcane magic is illegal.

#### Thieves Guild

The Thieves Guild is a highly organized crime syndicate with branches all throughout Maga.

#### Bards Guild

The Bards Guild is an association of bards, or epic poem writers.

### Church of Gora

The Church of Gora is the collective name for the adherents and clergy of the worship of Gora, the only officially recognized religion in Maga. Gora worshippers will sometimes go on missions to convert members of beast-races throughout Maga, who often times worship Demon Lords.

#### The Silver Sword

The Silver Sword is an organization dedicated to hunting demon worshippers, necromancy, vampires, werewolves, and other creatures they deem unholy.

### Demonic Cults

Every Demon Lord has his or her own group of worshippers. In particular, the patron/matron deities of the beast-races have large numbers of followers. Not all cults are inherently malicious, but some are, and all must practice in secret due to the illegal status of their religion.

### Vampire Clans

Vampires will sometimes form clans.

### Bandit/Pirate Groups and Crime Syndicates

Aside from the Thieves Guild, there are a number of bandit and pirates that group together, as well as organized crime syndicates. They are not named here, but they are not uncommon in the less ruly parts of Maga.
