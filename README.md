The Isles of Maga
=================
Isles of Maga is a role playing setting that I am creating, in particular for use with the Basic Fantasy RPG (BFRPG). However it is general enough to be used by other systems. In particular I am interested in adapting FUDGE to work well in the setting.

The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, and you are expected to make alterations in your campaign to suit yourself. Here is the basic information for how things work in the year 2E308 (the 308th year of the Modern Republic).

You will notice that other than the Oza Province, very few specific geographical facts are given. The idea behind this is to give players and GMs a frame of reference without binding them to the history and geography of any one particular region. While the entirety of Maga is claimed by the Republic, certain regions are technically outside of its rule. This gives plenty of room for a variety of complex political situations, and the scale of area and elevation gives some flexibility in climate.

A bestiary was omitted. There are more than enough monsters in the Fantasy Field Guide to last you for a while, so I decided against it. If I am inspired, a bestiary may be written in the future. Note that only the four main races are playable right now; the beast-races need to be balanced a lot.
