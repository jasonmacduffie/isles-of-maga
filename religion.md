Religion
========

Gora
----
The "good" religion in Maga is monotheistic, worshipping the deity called Gora. However, Gora does not actively perform miracles, and the power of Clerics, like Magic-Users, comes from their life energy rather than a blessing from Gora. In fact, there is no physical evidence that Gora exists, but rather his existence is based on an oral tradition dating thousands of years that eventually became a written tradition and organized into churches.

Demon Lords
-----------
However, there are a large number of "evil" religions in Maga, each serving a Demon Lord. Unlike Gora, the existence of Demon Lords is undeniable and apparent. Although the worship of the Demon Lords is forbidden culturally and legally, they all have their own share of worshippers. Demon Lords are considered evil compared to Gora, and while they generally tend to be misanthropic, some actually follow a more complex grey morality. Furthermore, all the beast races traditionally worship a patron or matron Demon Lord rather than Gora (although some do worship Gora), and have a much more positive perception of the Demon Lord they follow.

A Cleric, then, is permitted to serve a Demon Lord as a patron/matron deity, but they cannot do so openly. The effects of such a relationship between a Cleric and a Demon Lord are not defined here. As stated earlier, the power of Clerics does not come from a blessing, but from their life-energy. It is possible that knowledge from a Demon Lord gives access to new powers, however.

Demon Lords all have their own region in the land of Demonia. Demonia is located deep underground, far deeper than any mortal could possibly go. The different regions are called Baronies of Demonia. Each Lord also has their own kind of demons that fit their nature.

These are some of the major Demon Lords (feel free to make new ones):

- **Pastorum**, Patron of Ghosts (worshipped by Corvidines). His demons are called Nonces, which are the ghosts of deceased sentient races. Upon death, a Nonce retains the memories of its life, but loses its sense of identity. His Barony is called Arcadia, a land of rolling hills and meadows that are perpetually lit by moonlight. His appearance is of a human skeleton in a robe, with the skull of a bull. In one hand he holds a shepherd's crook, and in the other hand he holds a box lantern.
- **Umbrarum**, Matron of Shadows (worshipped by Vespertines). Her demons are, likewise, called Shadows, which are incorporeal manifestations of darkness. Her Barony is called The Silent Vale, and is a large grassland where it is always night, lacking even a moon and only lit by the stars. Her appearance is that of a woman with pitch black skin, wearing a garment that is equally dark and featureless. She has on her belt a dagger, and holds a longbow with a quiver of arrows on her back.
- **Solum**, Matron of Light (worshipped by Felidines). Her demons are called Zegnas, which appear as human beings with featureless, alabaster white skin, and the wings of doves. Solum's Barony is called The Sunpeaks, which are a white rocky terrain where there is always sunlight. Her appearance is simply that of a giant Zegna, dressed in a suit of steel armor and a white cape, holding a longsword in her right hand and a round shield in her left hand.
- **Vitarum**, Matron of the Woods (worshipped by Lacertines). Her demons are called Ursoths, which appear like ordinary, slightly larger than normal bears. However, Ursoths are intelligent and can speak. Vitarum's Barony is called the Twilight Pines, a tremendous pine forest with trees so high the sun is always eclipsed. Her Barony is home to a large number of animals we would recognize, and also many we would not. Her appearance is that of a woman wearing the attire of a priestess. She holds a tall staff that looks like a living tree branch with leaves still attached. On her belt is an apothecary satchel.
- **Primarium**, Patron of Disaster. His demons are called Elementals, which are intelligent beings made of fire, water, air, or earth. His Barony is called Tormentia, a region where the land never sits still. There are constant earthquakes and landslides, incredible gusts and lightning, and tremendous fires and tsunamis. His appearance is as chaotic as his domain: he is a mixture of flames, water, wind, and rock. He does not hold a constant shape, but typically presents himself as humanoid.
- **Terror**, Patron of Fear. His demons are called Angstworms, which are worm-like creatures as large as an alligator and with reptilian hide. Angstworms have no head, face, or eyes, although they do have a mouth with sharp teeth. Terror's Barony is called The Void Realms, and is made of large rocks floating in space. The Angstworms are able to fly and move around freely in this medium. It is possible for a human to fall off one of the rocks and into an abyss. Terror's appearance is that of a deformed man, with tentacles coming from random parts of his body, and one eye completely overtaken by a large tumor. Slime pours from his mouth. To some extent he is a shapeshifter, but all of his forms are equally horrible.
- **Ultimatum**, Patron of the End Times. His demons are called Doomstrickens, which take the form of human beings with horns and pits of darkness for eyes. Ultimatum's Barony is called Tempus, a bizarre region where time can move quickly or slowly depending on which part you are in. Tempus does not looks very different from our world, having a sun and moon, plants and animals. However it looks distinctly gloomy compared to ours. Ultimatum takes the form of an elderly man, who is usually depicted sitting down, watching a giant hourglass in front of him.
