Atmosphere
==========
Evil beings infest our world. Their names are Ignorance, Superstition, and Bigotry: the most sinister and tyrannical monsters your adventurers will face. The Isles of Maga has misanthropic creatures, to be sure, but most are animalistic and merely following their instincts. Even the Demon Lords are not "evil" per se, but have natures that are alien to us. My purpose for writing the Isles of Maga setting is to illustrate a world that allows for epic adventures, balanced with a nuanced understanding of moral conflict. The major points are these:

- **White to Grey Morality:** No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks. Although corruption, greed, and extremism plague Maga, few people have truly misanthropic intentions. A villain in your campaign who commits extreme wrongdoing should be working at a good end, albeit in the completely wrong way.

- **Political over Moral Conflict:** The history of Maga is not guided primarily by the interference of gods, although the influence of the Demon Lords does exist. Rather, it is the feuding between the mortal races that has shaped society for better or worse. Religious conflict is largely a proxy for our mortal weaknesses, and the Demon Lords have no power outside of what their worshippers can give them.

- **"Evil" Gods are Close; the "Good" God is Distant:** The existence of Demon Lords is undeniable, and they do hold power in this world. However, worship of Gora is the only recognized legitimate religion in Maga, but there is scarce evidence for the existence of Gora.

- **Magic is Regulated:** Anybody can use magic if they learn the correct incantation. However, there are only a few practitioners of magic in Maga. The Mages Guild specifically exists to sanction and regulate the use of magic, and to limit public access to magical knowledge. It is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast magic, but some do it anyway.

- **Demon Lords are human-like:** Demon Lords are not very different from humans. They can be petty, jealous, angry, or sad, and this will govern their actions. Look at Greek mythology for a better understanding of what I mean. Out of jealousy Hera tried to kill Hercules, a son of Zeus (her husband) and a human woman. Two important human-like things are present here: gods can feel lust (and cheat), and gods can feel jealous (and get revenge). While Demon Lords are somewhat more detached from our reality than the Greek gods were, they are still not abstract entities.

- **Racial conflict:** Racism/Speciesism exists both on formal and informal levels. In particular, Dwarves and Elves have a long history of animosity towards each other, dating even before the colonization of Maga. Furthermore, beast-races are seen as less than Dwarves, Elves, Halfings, or Humans. Many other sentient races refuse to integrate with the Republic out of principle, due to believing it has no right to exist.

- **Cosmopolitan world:** The eight playable races all hold citizenship in the Republic, and are well integrated in the major cities. Even in a predominantly "Halfling" village, you may see one or two members of the beast-races. Even in the "Dwarven" capital, you are likely to see a few humans and halflings along with them.

Technology
----------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of cannons and guns. There are also magical constructs, which are mindless machines that were animated by magic.
