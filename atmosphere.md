Atmosphere
==========
My purpose for writing the Isles of Maga setting is to illustrate a world that allows for epic adventures, balanced with a nuanced understanding of moral conflict. The major points are these:

- **White to Grey Morality:** No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks. Although corruption, greed, and extremism plague Maga, few people have truly misanthropic intentions. A villain in your campaign who commits extreme wrongdoing should be working at a good end, albeit in the completely wrong way.

- **"Evil" Gods are Close; the "Good" God is Distant:** The existence of Demon Lords is undeniable, and they do hold power in this world. However, worship of Gora is the only recognized legitimate religion in Maga, but there is scarce evidence for the existence of Gora.

- **Magic is Regulated:** Anybody can use magic if they learn the correct incantation. However, there are only a few practitioners of magic in Maga. The Mages Guild specifically exists to sanction and regulate the use of magic, and to limit public access to magical knowledge. It is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast magic, but some do it anyway.

- **Demon Lords are human-like:** Demon Lords are not very different from humans. They can be petty, jealous, angry, or sad, and this will govern their actions. Look at Greek mythology for a better understanding of what I mean. Out of jealousy Hera tried to kill Hercules, a son of Zeus (her husband) and a human woman. Two important human-like things are present here: gods can feel lust (and cheat), and gods can feel jealous (and get revenge). While Demon Lords are somewhat more detached from our reality than the Greek gods were, they are still not abstract entities.

- **Racial conflict:** Racism/Speciesism exists both on formal and informal levels. In particular, Dwarves and Elves have a long history of animosity towards each other, dating even before the colonization of Maga. Furthermore, beast-races are seen as less than Dwarves, Elves, Halfings, or Humans. Many other sentient races refuse to integrate with the Republic out of principle, due to believing it has no right to exist.

- **Cosmopolitan world:** The eight playable races all hold citizenship in the Republic, and are well integrated in the major cities. Even in a predominantly "Halfling" village, you may see one or two members of the beast-races. Even in the "Dwarven" capital, you are likely to see a few humans and halflings along with them.

- **Ocean travel:** Because the islands are quite small (a typical size being 500 or so square miles), most locations on the same island are a day's travel at most. A distant location will certainly need a boat to reach, making water travel critical in Maga. Furthermore, ancient Lacertine-built structures from before colonization dot the ocean floor, giving possibilities for extensive underwater exploration.

Metaphysics
-----------
There is only one world: the physical world that we occupy in Maga. As stated earlier, Demonia is not in another plane of existence. Rather, it is deep underground. Portals to Demonia physically teleport what passes through it, the same as other teleportation magic. Magic is also physical: it comes from a creature's life energy, for Magic-Users through their knowledge and for Clerics through their faith.

Although there is only one world, it is possible to traverse alternate timelines using magic. However, it is difficult to do so and the impact of such travel on Maga has been minimal. Only Ultimatum, Demon Lord of the End Times, has full knowledge of how these alternate timelines work and refuses to let mortals use such powerful magic for petty reasons.

Technology
----------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of cannons and guns.

There are also magical constructs, which are machines that were animated by magic. Most constructs are mindless automatons, but there are constructs with the intelligence of the sentient races called Mechanids. These are far and few between in Maga. The reason is that nobody knows how to create Mechanids anymore, and the civilization that created the Mechanids that exist never populated Maga. Therefore, any Mechanids in Maga almost certainly came from Honstrad.
