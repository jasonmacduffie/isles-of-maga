Geography and Politics
======================

Physical Geography
------------------
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area; nobody is certain exactly how large it is, and many pockets are isolated from the major islands. The islands generally have a tropical climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat between subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and severity of their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of Magathos is a single large mountain, which is tall enough to be snow-capped. As a result of the difference of elevation, this island has alpine grasslands, forests, and tundra. There are other islands in Maga that are tall enough to be snow-capped, but none as tremendous as Magathos.

The Isles of Maga are in the Sunbound Ocean, far away from any mainland continent, although some exist. Historically there has been trade with the closest mainland in the west, called Honstrad, but in recent history travel has been cut off.

Political Geography
-------------------
Maga is governed by the Modern Republic. Clusterings of islands form a province; the province that gets the most attention in this document is the Capital Province (Magathos Region), which contains the capital and nearby islands.

The capital of the country is Thronerock, located in the mountain of Magathos. Other large cities on the surface of Magathos are Honuda, Grostine, Ledalia, and Sorrowport, with smaller towns and villages dotting the island. Nearby major islands are Veldoth, Ruzark, Eyedea, Northsky, Olivon, Hosland, Brightwater, and Shaleport. Each island has at least one large port city, which is the center of most trade. The larger islands generally also have significant insland trade.

Although the inside of Magathos is very developed by Dwarves, the higher elevations have largely been touched by civilization. The coastal cities are connected by water travel and tunnels through the mountain. A great number of unique wildlife make their homes on the higher elevations, as well as some unintegrated beast races.

Political System
----------------
The Modern Republic has a president as head of state. The representatives are chosen by the Electorate, who are the descendants of the revolutionaries who violently overthrew the Elven Kingdoms that preceded the Republic. The majority of the Electorate are Dwarves, with a significant minority of Humans and Halflings. Elves represent a very small minority of the Electorate; less than 1% are Elves, who are the descendants of those Elves that rebelled against their own kingdom. None of the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) have any members in the Electorate. As of 2E308, the president is Grulth Skullstone, an elderly Dwarf who personally participated in the establishing of the Republic in a minor role.
