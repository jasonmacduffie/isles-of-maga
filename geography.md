Geography and Political Notes
=============================
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area; nobody is certain exactly how large it is, and many pockets are isolated from the major islands. The islands generally have a tropical climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat between subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and severity of their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of Magathos is a single large mountain, which is tall enough to be snow-capped. As a result of the difference of elevation, this island has alpine grasslands, forests, and tundra. There are other islands in Maga that are tall enough to be snow-capped, but none as tremendous as Magathos.

The Isles of Maga are in the Sunbound Ocean, far away from any mainland continent, although some exist. Historically there has been trade with the closest mainland in the west, called Honstrad, but in recent history travel has been cut off.

All of Maga is governed by the Modern Republic since the start of the Second Era. The Modern Republic has a president as head of state. The representatives are chosen by the Electorate, who are the descendants of the revolutionaries who violently overthrew the Elven Kingdoms that preceded the Republic. The majority of the Electorate are Dwarves, with a significant minority of Humans and Halflings. Elves represent a very small minority of the Electorate; less than 1% are Elves, who are the descendants of those Elves that rebelled against their own kingdom. None of the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) have any members in the Electorate. As of 2E308, the president is Grulth Skullstone, an elderly Dwarf who personally participated in the establishing of the Republic in a minor role. Note that there are also local governments, of which non-electorate members have more control.

While all of Maga is claimed by the Republic, there are many pockets of resistance from many sources: demon worshippers, nativists, and monarchists are just a few examples. The Republic does not have total control of all the islands, and some could be said to technically have governments of their own. However, such locations will always be under constant threat from the Republic enforcing its sovereignty.

The official name for Republic-minted coins made of gold, silver, and copper respectively are orims, silbrims, and cuprims, respectively. Platinum and electrum coins are not minted by the Republic, and are not used as currency.

Honstrad
--------
Honstrad is a continent that lies between the Northfrost Ocean, Sunbound Ocean, and Atlas Ocean. Before the colonization of Maga, there were nine regions in Honstrad called Rich Coast, Cyrilia, Frostgard, Autumn Marsh, Avodan, Rocky Mountains, Netherwood, Grey Mountain, and Sunrise Isles. Each region is the homeland of nine races, respectively: Minikins, Dwarves, Noctfel, Magafel, Northwatch, Hammerkins, Rubefel, Draculs, and Iavols.

Underground
-----------
Beneath the surface, there are civilizations of various races living in the earth. Based on how deep you are, there will be different species one encounters.

### Near Neath

For the first few hundred feet exists the Near Neath. This is where Dwarves, Goblins, and other common underground races tend to live. Most do not stay permanently here, and make frequent trips to the surface.

### Middle Neath

Less common underground races live in the Middle Neath, and rarely travel to the surface.

### Far Neath

The Far Neath is part of the crust that is kept warm by the planet's mantle. As one goes deeper and deeper, the earth becomes unhospitably warm.

### Demonia

Demonia refers to the various realms of the Demon Lords, located farther underground than the mantle. Often times, Demonia is simply used as a swear. For example, "What in Demonia happened to you?" could be a common expression.
