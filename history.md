History

First Era: The Magafeli Empire
------------------------------
The High Elves were the first race to discover the island chain of Maga, and began colonizing it. Over time, the land of Maga became wealthy because of its rich resources. Following the wealth, the other races began to immigrate to Maga as well.

After many centuries of interaction with the continent of Honstrad, communication ceased. Nobody knows the reason for this, but ships that sailed west towards Honstrad never returned. Now, many centuries later, Honstrad is known only by historical records.

Over time, the other colonist races of Maga felt resentment towards that Magafel. Without any connection to the mainland of Honstrad, the fact that the High Elves ruled Maga became increasingly arbitrary.

More than a millenium after Honstrad was discovered, the other races rose up against the Magafeli Empire and established the Modern Republic in its place.

Second Era: The Modern Republic
------------------------------
Maga is now 50 years into the establishment of the Republic. Although the largest portion of the Magafeli Empire has fallen, some remnants stand against the Republic.
