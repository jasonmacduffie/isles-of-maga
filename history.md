History
=======
Although it has been touched upon, here is an organized account of the history of Maga.

Before 1E
---------
### Before Colonization

Before the arrival of Dwarves, Elves, Humans, and Halflings, there is strong evidence that Maga was under the rule of a powerful Orcish civilization. However, the Orcs did not keep a history of their civilization, so very little is known about it. The arrival of the four main races did not disrupt their civilization; it had collapsed into the tribal society prior to that. The reasons for this are unknown. Orcs are still organized in this manner into the second era.

During this time, the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) also populated the region. They likely were also ruled by the Orcish civilization.

### The Age of Exploration

From Honstrad, a continent in the west, the first Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings reach the shores of Maga. In the beginning their numbers were few, but as they explored more and more of Maga they became more prevalant. Eventually the majority of Maga became populated with the four main races. There were not many conflicts within these races, instead the focus being on clearing out the area of the hostile locals, including the beast races.

In particular, the Orcs were resistant to what they perceived as invaders. Up to the second era, the various Orcish tribes continue to put up a fight, although their numbers have diminished significantly. It is this continued hostility that has prevented from them being integrated with any of the upcoming civilizations, unlike the beast-races.

When the four races came to Maga, they brough many of their old institutions with them. This includes the Mercenaries Guild, Mages Guild, and Thieves Guild. They also brought their religious beliefs with them, most importantly the Elves brough the belief in Gora. The other major races had their own religions as well, but those have long died out since colonization. Lastly, Demon worship was not unheard of in Honstrad, but it was not nearly as prevalant as it is in Maga.

### The Age of Industry

Following was a time of peace, after the Orcish residents and other hostile races were mostly cleared out, and before the beginning of the formation of states that would develop soon. What were formerly small villages began to grow and eventually become cities. Dwarves continued to build underground, and the other races continued forming new villages and cities on the various islands. This time also marked the beginning of interaction with beast-races, and when people began to learn about the local worship of Demon Lords and share their religion.

Trade flourished during this time, and industries were becoming better established to fight off hostile races, sail the rougher parts of the waters, clearing out of the jungle terrain, and the development under Magathos by the Dwarves.

### The Age of Statecraft

As industry continued, separate races formed their own states. The greatest state belonged to the kingdom of the Dwarves, which held the seat of Thronerock which is still the location of the capital of the Modern Republic during the second era. Elves, Humans, and Halflings had smaller city states, but many were strong enough to compare to the unified Dwarven kingdom during the early days.

The Elves had worshipped Gora for many ages before, but for the first time worship of Gora was organized into churches as an organized religion. They viewed the demon worship of the natives as well as the other main races as disgusting and evil given the misanthropic tendencies of some Demon Lords. However, they were not in a position to do anything about it, and traded with these races anyway.

The Dwarves were proud of their strength as a country, and limited their interaction with the other races during this time. They would continue carving out huge castles under Magathos. The other races, on the other hand, had more or less amicable relations with each other and traded with one another.

The Elves saw an increase of power through non-military means, by enveloping Human and Halfling city states with the promise of greater protection from hostile races like the Orcs, and access to important islands for trade. The city states retained their autonomy in terms of laws, but would swear fealty towards these Elven kings and paid a small tax to them.

Before the first era began, the various Elven kings controlled most of Maga, except for around the Magathos region. Seeing that the Dwarves were weakened, and the economic importance of Magathos, the Elves launched a full scale invasion. The Dwarves were completely unprepared for this. They fought valiantly, but in the end the Elves controlled Magathos and the surrounding area, and the Magathos region established its own kingdom ruled by an Elf monarch.

1E: The Elven Kingdoms
----------------------
The beginning of the first era saw the first unification of the races under one banner: the banner of the Elves. This unification marks the first era. There was not a centralized government, but a number of allied kingdoms, each with an Elf as monarch. Elvish was the Common language, although this was not strictly enforced and many regions had the majority race's language as a co-official language. Each race was still free to use its own alphabet for their language.

This era also saw the greatest attempt to completely stamp out demon worship. By the end of the first era, worship of Demon Lords among Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings was nearly completely obliterated, and all worshipped the more abstract deity Gora. Less effort was put into stamping out worship among the beast-races due to the fact that they were not integrated as citizens, although some minor missions were carried out.

Although in the beginning the Elven kings and queens were careful to be even-handed, the descendants who would inherit their thrones became increasingly unconcerned with the needs of their subjects. Many of the monarchs during the end of the period were incredibly harsh, even to Humans who held the highest positions in society besides Elves. Halfling farmers and Dwarf miners were taxed more and more onerously.

2E: The Modern Republic
-----------------------
The revolution that ended the first era gave rise to the Modern Republic. Contemporary Elvish was already the de-facto standard language across the isles, but the Republic formalized this and renamed it to Common. The four main races and beast races were also required to use the Common alphabet when writing in their own languages, even though not all sounds could be properly pronounced with it. This has been the source of some minor friction with the Republic.

Elven structures were often abandoned, destroyed, or repurposed during the revolution. In particular, many Elven castles were repurposed as government buildings for the Republic.

The Republic is a federated state divided into a large number of provinces, each of which manages its own subregions in a similar fashion. However, the provinces have less control over their population than the Kingdoms did, and some areas have become retaken by Orcs and other native creatures. Some areas are fairly isolated, and are part of the Republic in name only.

The Republic continued the goal of the Elves to stamp out demon worship. However, their task was not as great due to the work already accomplished. The main area of focus was the beast-races and their patron/matron Demon Lords, now that they were considered full citizens of the Republic.
