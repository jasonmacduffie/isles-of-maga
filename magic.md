Magic
=====
Magic (both divine and arcane) comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, arcane magic is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very controlled by the Mages Guild. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life unless there is a local Mages Guild. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power. In fact, it is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast arcane spells.

Most spell casters, both divine and arcane, are women. In ancient times spell casters were almost exclusively women, and many famous magicians in history were women. Historically, men who used magic had a reputation for being effeminate. That has not been true for a long time and as a result the divide is much smaller today, such that the ratio is about 3 to 1. In more traditional societies like Orcish tribes, spell casters are still almost exclusively women.

Divine magic is not regulated at all, unlike arcane magic, and your local neighborhood priest probably knows a healing spell or two. The Mages Guild holds no responsibility for the magic of Clerics.

Because magic is not "prepared" as in the default BFRPG rules, it is suggested that you use the Liberal Casting system plus Slot Demotion available from the Magic-User Options supplement. This supplement is a more accurate portrayal of how magic works in-universe. Count the spell "Read Magic" as giving the Magic-User an addition level 1 slot (so a level 1 Magic-User has two level 1 slots). This also means that a spellbook is technically unnecessary for a Magic-User, although it may be useful to carry a grimoire for knowledge the Magic-User cannot remember.

Raise Dead and Reincarnate still work as per the BFRPG rules, however doing so may raise the anger of Pastorum, who expected a new ghost to serve him. Therefore, bringing people back to life is uncommon and taboo in Maga, but still possible if they died recently and not of old age.

Animate Dead for use as mindless minions such as zombies or skeletons is considered necromancy in Maga, which is outlawed. Note that Magic-Users and Clerics are still *able* to do so, but not in the open. Clerics who are known necromancers will no longer be welcome in the Church of Gora and Magic-Users who are known necromancers will lose their membership in the Mages Guild. The Silver Sword (a subfaction in the Church of Gora) actively hunts down and kills necromancers.

Some spells are tweaked to make more sense in the setting:

- **Detect Evil** becomes **Detect Demonic**: The spell is only useful for detecting the presence of demons and demonic powers; it has nothing to do with evil intentions. The reverse is **Detect Anti-Demonic**. The exact same principle applies to **Protection from Evil** becoming **Protection from Demonic** (reverse **Protection from Anti-Demonic**), and **Dispel Evil** becoming **Dispel Demonic**. Undead creatures are considered demonic, largely because of the close association of necromancy and Pestium in Maga.

- **Commune** does not contact a patron deity; instead it contacts a particular Demon Lord, or at least a servant demon if the Lord is not available. The Demon Lord does not need to be the patron of that cleric. The Demon Lord must be willing to talk to the Cleric for the spell to work, however.

- **Conjure Elemental** summons one of Primarium's demons to fight for you. Elementals are all Primarium's servants, but when you summon one it is under your control.

Anti-Demonic
------------
Anti-Demonic magic is imbued with the power to cause great harm to demons. It is not divine per se; it is a physical force, no different from magical fire or the magic that powers mechanical constructs. It is possible for certain Anti-Demonic spells to harm non-demons, but still cause much greater harm to demons. Interestingly, silver weapons have a natural Anti-Demonic aura which is detectable by Detect Anti-Demonic. Clerics of Gora, through their faith, give off a faint Anti-Demonic aura unintentionally. It is not strong enough to cause harm to demons but it is enough to detect using Detect Anti-Demonic. Likewise, Clerics of Demon Lords, through their faith, give off a faint Demonic aura unintentionally. Clerics without a deity give no such aura.

Undead creatures are considered demonic, and are harmed by Anti-Demonic magic.
