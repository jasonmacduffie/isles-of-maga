Magic
=====
Magic (both divine and arcane) comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, arcane magic is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very controlled by the Mages Guild. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life unless there is a local Mages Guild. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power. In fact, it is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast arcane spells.

Most spell casters, both divine and arcane, are women. In ancient times spell casters were almost exclusively women, and many famous magicians in history were women. Historically, men who used magic had a reputation for being effeminate. That has not been true for a long time and as a result the divide is much smaller today, such that the ratio is about 3 to 1. In more traditional societies like Orcish tribes, spell casters are still almost exclusively women.

Divine magic is not regulated at all, unlike arcane magic, and your local neighborhood priest probably knows a healing spell or two. The Mages Guild holds no responsibility for the magic of Clerics.

Magic is not "prepared" as in the default BFRPG rules, and is much closer to the way the Sorcerer supplement works (i.e. mana points). However, feel free to use the default magic system or liberal casting as an abstraction for the purpose of keeping balance. Furthermore a spellbook is technically unnecessary for a Magic-User, although it may be useful to carry a grimoire for knowledge the Magic-User cannot remember.

Read Magic is not a separate spell for Magic-Users, and instead they can simply understand spellbooks or scrolls by looking at them. There is not a separate language for magical texts, and the Magic-User will need to understand the language the book or scroll is written in. Likewise, Read Languages works perfectly well on scrolls and spellbooks.

Raise Dead and Reincarnate still work as per the BFRPG rules, however doing so may raise the anger of Pastorum, who expected a new ghost to serve him. Therefore, bringing people back to life is uncommon and taboo in Maga, but still possible if they died recently and not of old age.

Animate Dead for use as mindless minions such as zombies or skeletons is considered necromancy in Maga, which is outlawed. Note that Magic-Users and Clerics are still *able* to do so, but not in the open. Clerics who are known necromancers will no longer be welcome in the Church of Gora and Magic-Users who are known necromancers will lose their membership in the Mages Guild. The Silver Sword (a subfaction in the Church of Gora) actively hunts down and kills necromancers.

Some spells are tweaked to make more sense in the setting:

- **Detect Evil** becomes **Detect Demonic**: The spell is only useful for detecting the presence of demons and demonic powers; it has nothing to do with evil intentions. The reverse is **Detect Anti-Demonic**. The exact same principle applies to **Protection from Evil** becoming **Protection from Demonic** (reverse **Protection from Anti-Demonic**), and **Dispel Evil** becoming **Dispel Demonic**. Undead creatures are considered demonic, largely because of the close association of necromancy and Pestium in Maga.

- **Commune** does not contact a patron deity; instead it contacts a particular Demon Lord, or at least a servant demon if the Lord is not available. The Demon Lord does not need to be the patron of that cleric. The Demon Lord must be willing to talk to the Cleric for the spell to work, however.

- **Conjure Elemental** summons one of Primarium's demons to fight for you. Elementals are all Primarium's servants, but when you summon one it is under your control.

Anti-Demonic
------------
Anti-Demonic magic is imbued with the power to cause great harm to demons. It is not divine per se; it is a physical force, no different from magical fire or the magic that powers mechanical constructs. It is possible for certain Anti-Demonic spells to harm non-demons, but still cause much greater harm to demons. Interestingly, silver weapons have a natural Anti-Demonic aura which is detectable by Detect Anti-Demonic. Clerics of Gora, through their faith, give off a faint Anti-Demonic aura unintentionally. It is not strong enough to cause harm to demons but it is enough to detect using Detect Anti-Demonic. Likewise, Clerics of Demon Lords, through their faith, give off a faint Demonic aura unintentionally. Clerics without a deity give no such aura.

Furthermore, Clerics of Gora cannot wield Demonic artifacts and Clerics of Demon Lords cannot wield Anti-Demonic artifacts. Note that it is possible to touch the artifact without being harmed, but it cannot be equipped for its effect.

Undead creatures are considered demonic, and are harmed by Anti-Demonic magic.

New Spells
----------
Maga has spells unique to the setting.

### Summon Bound Weapon

Cleric, 1

A Cleric can bind a weapon to his or her soul without cost, provided some time has been spent bonding with the weapon. The binding never expires, and the binding may be dismissed by the Cleric at any time. The binding can be broken by casting Dispel Magic. This spell summons the weapon to the Cleric's hand instantly through teleportation.

### Ghost Blade

Magic-User, 1

Duration: 1 round/level

The Magic-User equips a blade of magic from their hand. This weapon may be of various sizes, as long as that weapon can be equipped by the caster. The damage changes based on the length of the blade.

- Dagger-length: 1d4 damage
- Shortsword-length: 1d6 damage
- Longsword-length: 1d8 damage
- Two-Handed sword-length: 1d10 damage (must be held in both hands)

The weapon itself has no weight. If the Magic-User lets go of the weapon, it disappears. The weapon can also be destroyed by Dispel Magic. At the end of the duration, the weapon vanishes. The weapon is magical, and can do damage to ghosts.

Psykers
-------
Just as Clerics access divine magic through faith, and Magic-Users access arcane magic through esoterica, there is a third kind of spell caster called a Psyker that can use psionic magic through willpower. For this reason, they use the Charisma ability to measure their force of personality as their primary ability. There are no "sorcerers" as a separate class in Maga, but Psykers are conceptually close to the sorcerer.

Psykers are very uncommon, thus there is no legal regulation of psionic magic. For these people, casting spells is an innate gift allowing them to transform the world around them at will.

There is no separation of psionics from other forms of magic, and their resource is still the "life-energy" that is the resource of Clerics and Magic-Users. Likewise, casting "detect magic" will work just as well on psionic magic as other kinds of magic.
