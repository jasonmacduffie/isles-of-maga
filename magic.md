Magic
=====
Magic (both divine and arcane) comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, anybody can cast magic. However, arcane magic is a difficult talent to acquire, and the arts are very controlled by the Mages Guild. Therefore, most people will not have even seen a magic user in their life unless there is a local Mages Guild. A great deal of effort is taken by magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power. In fact, it is illegal for non-members of the Mages Guild to cast arcane spells.

Divine magic is not regulated at all, unlike arcane magic, and your local neighborhood priest probably knows a healing spell or two. The Mages Guild holds no responsibility for the magic of Clerics.

Because magic is not "prepared" as in the default BFRPG rules, there are alternative rules the GM may use for Magic-Users and Clerics. The rules are simple: a Magic-User learns spells in the ordinary way at the same rate, and a Cleric has access to all spells available at the ordinary rate. However, instead of preparation, a spellcaster can cast any available spell at will. Doing so will consume an amount of "spell points" equal to the spell level. For example, a Level 2 spell will cost 2 spell points.

Spell points return to the maximum amount overnight. A character's spell points is equal to the character level, plus an ability bonus. In the case of Magic-Users, the bonus is their Intelligence. In the case of Clerics, the bonus is their Wisdom. For example, a level 3 Magic-User with an Intelligence bonus of +1 will have a maximum spell points of 4.

Raise Dead and Reincarnate still work as per the BFRPG rules, however doing so may raise the anger of Pastorum, who expected a new ghost to serve him. Therefore, bringing people back to life is uncommon and taboo in Maga, but still possible if they died recently and not of old age.

Animate Dead for use as mindless minions such as zombies or skeletons is considered necromancy in Maga, which is outlawed. Note that Magic-Users and Clerics are still *able* to do so, but not in the open. Clerics who are known necromancers will no longer be welcome in the Church of Gora and Magic-Users who are known necromancers will lose their membership in the Mages Guild. The Silver Sword (a subfaction in the Church of Gora) actively hunts down and kills necromancers.

Some spells are tweaked to make more sense in the setting:

- **Detect Evil** becomes **Detect Demonic**: The spell is only useful for detecting the presence of demons and demonic powers; it has nothing to do with evil intentions. The reverse is **Detect Anti-Demonic**. The exact same principle applies to **Protection from Evil** becoming **Protection from Demonic** (reverse **Protection from Anti-Demonic**), and **Dispel Evil** becoming **Dispel Demonic**. Note that undead creatures in particular are not considered demonic (though they are magical), unless they are explicitly demons. Anti-Demonic objects are ones that are imbued with the power to cause great harm to demons. The most common kind of anti-demonic objects are silver weapons.

- **Commune** does not contact a patron deity; instead it contacts a particular Demon Lord, or at least a servant demon if the Lord is not available. The Demon Lord does not need to be the patron of that cleric. The Demon Lord must be willing to talk to the Cleric for the spell to work, however.

- **Conjure Elemental** summons one of Primarium's demons to fight for you. Elementals are all Primarium's servants, but when you summon one it is under your control.
