The Isles of Maga
=================
The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, but here is what is 
common knowledge.

Physical Geography
------------------
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area of nearly one million 
square kilometers (approximately the size of Kazakhstan) and contains 
thousands of islands if not more. The islands all have a tropical 
climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat between 
subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and severity of 
their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of Magathos has a mountain 
range called the Otris Mountains, the peaks of which are tall enough to 
be snow-capped. As a result of the difference of elevation, this island 
has alpine grasslands, forests, and tundra.

The Isles of Maga are in the Sunbound Ocean, far away from any mainland 
continent, although some exist. Historically there has been trade with 
the closest mainland in the west, called Honstrad, but in recent history 
travel has been cut off.

Political Geography
-------------------
Maga is governed by the Modern Republic. Clusterings of islands form a 
district; the district that gets the most attention in this document is 
the Capital District, which contains the capital and nearby islands.

The capital of the country is Thronerock, located in the Otris Mountains 
in Magathos. Other cities in Magathos are Honuda, Grostine, Ledalia, and 
Sorrowport. Nearby major islands are Veldoth, Ruzark, Eyedea, Northsky, 
Olivon, Hosland, Brightwater, and Shaleport. Each island has at least 
one port city, which is the center of most trade. The cities on Magathos 
also have a significant inland trade.

Magathos has an area of 5,000 square kilometers, and is the largest 
island in Maga. The other islands listed vary in size, and are anywhere 
from 1,000 to 4,000 square kilometers. There are other important trade 
islands that are much smaller, being no more than 100 or so square 
kilometers.

Although the inside of the Otris Mountains are very developed by 
dwarves, the outside of the mountains have not largely been touched by 
civilization. A great number of unique wildlife make their homes there, 
as well as some unintegrated beast races.

Political System
----------------
The Modern Republic has a president as head of state. The 
representatives are chosen by the Electorate, who are the descendants of 
the revolutionaries who violently overthrew the Elven Kingdoms that 
preceded the Republic. The majority of the Electorate are dwarves, with 
a significant minority of humans and halflings. Elves represent a very 
small minority of the Electorate; less than 1% are elves, who are the 
descendants of those elves that rebelled against their own kingdom. None 
of the beast races (Lacertines, Felidines, Corvidines, and Vespertines) 
have any members in the Electorate.

Technology and Magic
--------------------
The technology is around that of the European middle ages, although 
there is room for flexibility. For example, it is possible that 
gunpowder has been discovered recently leading to the invention of 
cannons and guns. There are also magical constructs, which are mindless 
machines that were animated by magic.

Magic comes from a person's internal "life energy," so, in principle, 
anybody can cast magic. However, it is a difficult talent to acquire, 
and the arts are very secretive. Therefore, most people will not have 
even seen a magic user in their life. A great deal of effort is taken by 
magic users to keep magic out of the hands of the public and kept the 
domain of specially trained magicians who can handle its power.

Religion
--------
The "good" religion in Maga is monotheistic, worshipping the deity 
called Gora. However, Gora does not actively perform miracles, and the 
power of clerics comes from their faith itself rather than an actual 
blessing from Gora. In fact, there is no physical evidence that Gora 
exists, but rather his existence is based on an oral tradition dating 
thousands of years that eventually became a written tradition and 
organized into churches.

However, there are a large number of "evil" religions in Maga, each 
serving a Demon Lord. Unlike Gora, the existence of Demon Lords is 
undeniable and apparent. Although the worship of the Demon Lords is 
forbidden culturally and legally, they all have their own share of 
worshippers. Demon Lords are considered evil compared to Gora, and while 
they generally tend to be misanthropic, some actually follow a more 
complex grey morality. Furthermore, all the beast races traditionally 
worship a patron or matron Demon Lord rather than Gora (although some do 
worship Gora), and have a much more positive perception of the Demon 
Lord they follow.

Demon Lords all have their own plane of existance, called the Demonic 
Planes. Each Lord also has their own kind of demons that fit their 
nature.

These are some of the major Demon Lords (feel free to make new ones):

- Pastorum, Patron of Ghosts
- Umbram, Matron of Shadows (worshipped by Vespertines and Corvidines)
- Solum, Matron of Purity (worshipped by Felidines)
- Vitam, Matron of Nature (worshipped by Lacertines)
- Morbum, Patron of Plague
- Terror, Patron of Fear
- Ultimatum, Patron of the End Times
