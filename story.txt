The Isles of Maga
=================

The history of Maga is scattered and mysterious, but here is what is
common knowledge.

Physical Geography
------------------
Maga is an island chain spanning a tremendous area of nearly
one million square kilometers (approximately the size of Kazakhstan)
and contains thousands of islands if not more. The islands all have
a tropical climate, although the flora and fauna varies somewhat
between subregions. The various subregions vary in the length and
severity of their wet and dry seasons. The largest island of
Magathos has a mountain range called the Otris Mountains, the peaks
of which can actually be quite dry and cold.
