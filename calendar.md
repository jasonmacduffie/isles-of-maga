Calendar
========
The colonists from Honstrad brought with them their calendar. There are twelve months, each of which has a birthsign to those born in that month. Given are the month names, the sign, and the days of that month.

- **First Ember** - The Ram - 31. *spring begins*
- **Second Ember** - The Bull - 30.
- **Third Ember** - The Magician - 31.
- **Fourth Ember** - The Crab - 30. *summer begins*
- **Fifth Ember** - The Lion - 31.
- **Sixth Ember** - The Priestess - 31.
- **Seventh Ember** - The Dragon - 30. *fall begins*
- **Eight Ember** - The Scorpion - 31.
- **Ninth Ember** - The Soldier - 30.
- **Tenth Ember** - The Goat - 31. *winter begins*
- **Eleventh Ember** - The Fish - 30.
- **Last Ember** - The Thief - 28.

The four non-animals each has two animal charges:

- **The Soldier:** Ram and Lion
- **The Priestess:** Bull and Goat
- **The Magician:** Dragon and Fish
- **The Thief:** Crab and Scorpion

Each sign has a unique quality (game mechanics not worked out yet):

- The Ram is daring, allowing those born under it to attack earlier in a fight.
- The Bull is stoic, allowing those born under it to resist fear.
- The Magician is sophisticated, allowing those born under it to learn more spells.

- The Lion is forceful, allowing those born under it to break solid objects.
- The Priestess is sensitive, allowing those born under it to detect the intentions of others.
- The Dragon is sassy, allowing those born under it to resist magic spells.
- The Scorpion is secretive, allowing those born under it to hide better.
- The Soldier is zealous, allowing those born under it to travel faster over long distances.
- The Goat is sociable, allowing those born under it to acquire many followers.
- The Fish is thoughtful, allowing those born under it to cast more spells per day.
- The Thief is shrewd, allowing those born under it to lie more convincingly.
