Factions
========
Since the fall of the Magafeli Empire, there is no longer a single government in control of Maga. However, the Modern Republic controls the majority of it at present.

Republicans
-----------
![Republic Flag](republic_flag.png)

Republican is a general term for those politically aligned with the Modern Republic. This includes loyal citizens of the Republic, public officials, and organizations employed by the Republic. The symbol of the Republic is a sun and moon fused together, representing the unity of races that cooperated in overthrowing the Magafeli Empire.

### The Order of Skulls

The Order of Skulls is not officially recognized as being part of the Republic, and some attempt is made to keep its existence secret. Nonetheless, rumors of its existence are abundant, and evidence of its actions stand. The Order of Skulls is the covert branch of the Republican government, acting for the office of the President in ensuring that the Republic continues to stand strong, sometimes using technically illegal methods.

### The Moonguard

The Moonguard, unlike the Order of Skulls, is an officially recognized organization within the Republic. The Moonguard have the responsibility to ensure order is kept under the Republic, and have chapters spread throughout the regions. Unlike the Order of Skulls, public scrutiny means they cannot resort to illegal action.

Monarchists
-----------
A significant number of Magafel still advocate the return of the Magafeli Empire. These people are known as monarchists. The symbol of the monarchists is a crescent moon, or "Autumn Moon", which is an ancient magical symbol strongly associated with the Magafel and sometimes Gora.

The Order of Ancients
---------------------
The Order of Ancients is a secretive organization that is not aligned with the Republic, Monarchists, or the Orcish Tribes. Rather, they adapt to each political circumstance, and attempt to influence policy to benefit their own ends. It is unknown whether the Order of Ancients really exists, or is just a rumor.

Nativists
---------
Nativists are sentient races native to Maga that fought against colonization, refusing to integrate with both the Magafeli Empire and now the Republic. To this day, Orcish Tribes and their allies continue to take up arms against the Republic and refuse integration with it out of principle. Most members of the nativist faction are Orves, but there are also members of the beast races that reject citizenship in the Republic, siding with the Nativists as well.

Guilds
------
There are a number of trade associations, called guilds, in Maga. They are not aligned with each other but are kept here for organizational purposes.

### Mercenaries Guild

The Mercenaries Guild is an organization sanctioned by the Republic to take contracts that require violence to resolve. The organization is responsible for managing the contracts and distributing them to properly trained individuals or groups. For this service the Mercenaries Guild takes a minor cut of the money. They cover many different kinds of jobs, from rat extermination to demon hunting. The Mercenaries Guild dislikes competition, and will try to forcibly shut down organizations with similar goals.

The only major rule of the Mercenaries Guild is that you must have a clean record with the Republic, as a Republic-sanctioned organization. If you commit a serious crime during a contract, it is a sure ticket to expulsion.

### Mages Guild

The Mages Guild is responsible for researching and dispensing magical knowledge. In particular, the Mages Guild makes a strong attempt to prevent magic from being accessible to the general public because of its immense power. Most Magic-Users should start out as members of the Mages Guild, otherwise their practice of arcane magic is illegal.

Aside from the ordinary things you would expect a guild to require, there are two special rules about the Mages Guild:

1. Share all magical knowledge you acquire with the Guild. This includes handing over magical artifacts for examination. If they are not of special interest, the artifact will be returned to you.
2. Do not share any magical knowledge with non-Guild members.

Magic-Users are permitted into the world of adventure under the premise that they are searching for magical secrets and items. If a Magic-User fails to procure evidence of their efforts, they can be investigated to have their Guild membership (which is their license to legally perform magic) revoked.

The Mages Guild are also the only legal magical service provider in Maga. For potions, wand recharging, etc. players must go to the Mages Guild.

### Thieves Guild

The Thieves Guild is a highly organized crime syndicate with branches all throughout Maga. Members of the Thieves Guild have access to fences and a network capable of clearing their name of minor crimes through bribery (although major ones, like murder, may be out of their capacity to help). In areas where the Thieves Guild is prominent, they dislike competition and may attempt to hinder would-be thieves. For this reason, it may be a good idea for characters of the Thief class to be members of the Thieves Guild from character creation. They may also see potential in a would-be thief, and will initiate them into the Guild.

Depending on the region, the Thieves Guild may be more or less active, but they generally have at least a small branch in every large city. They tend to hang around shady pubs where they can escape scrutiny. Higher profile branches may even exist in the open, but can use their complex network of bribery to ensure nobody trifles with them. Some legal authorities value the Thieves Guild as a way to ensure criminals act within certain boundaries, due to their rule of avoiding unwanted attention to the Guild.

There are four rules to the Thieves Guild:

1. Do not murder, especially during a heist.
2. Do not steal from or harm other members of the Thieves Guild.
3. Do not steal from or harm beggars, who are under the protection of the Thieves Guild.
4. Do not bring unwanted attention to the Thieves Guild (from legal authorities especially) or reveal any of our secrets.

Those who break any one of these rules is expelled.

### Assassins Guild

The Assassins Guild is much more underground than the Thieves Guild, and authorities generally have zero tolerance for them. Few towns have actual "halls" for the Assassins Guild, and they tend to be located in the wilderness. Contact with the Assassins Guild to hire a contract is done through a magic ritual that summons an assassin remotely to decide the details of the contract.

Joining the Assassins Guild is tricky business, as you cannot ask around town where the guild hall is. Using the ritual to summon them is unlikely to gain their attention, as they are quite selective in who they allow to join. Instead, it is more likely that a guild member will see something promisingly cold-blooded in an individual and initiate contact. If the individual refuses, contact is severed and that is the end of it. Otherwise, there may be a trial to see if the person is worthy of joining the guild.

Church of Gora
--------------
The Church of Gora is the collective name for the adherents and clergy of the worship of Gora, the only officially recognized religion in Maga. Gora worshippers will sometimes go on missions to convert members of beast-races throughout Maga, who often times worship Demon Lords.

### The Silver Sword

The Silver Sword is an organization dedicated to hunting demon worshippers, necrosmithing, vampires, werewolves, and other creatures they deem unholy. They specialize in anti-demonic magic, and wield silver weapons known for their anti-demonic properties. The Silver Sword originated in the United Church, but has emerged as its own entity, cooperating with local churches and performing missions abroad.

Demonic Cults
-------------
Every Demon Lord has his or her own group of worshippers. In particular, the patron deities of the beast-races have large numbers of followers. Not all cults are inherently malicious, but some are, and all must practice in secret due to the illegal status of their religion.

Vampire Clans
-------------
Vampires will sometimes form clans.

Crime Factions
--------------
Aside from the Thieves Guild, there are a number of bandit and pirates that group together, as well as organized crime syndicates. They are not uncommon in the less ruly parts of Maga.

### Firebeard the Pirate

Firebeard is a Kelt Fighter/Magic-User that roams the high seas with his crew. He has been terrorizing the seas and plundering for decades, and has yet to be even close to captured.
